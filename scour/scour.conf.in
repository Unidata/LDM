# Configuration file for the scour(1) utility for deleting old files from specified directories and
# all their subdirectories. Scour should be invoked periodically by cron(8).
#
# Each line consists of a directory, a retention time as [D][-hh[:mm]] (where D is days, hh is
# hours, and mm is minutes), and (optionally) a shell filename pattern for files to be deleted.  If
# no filename pattern is specified, "*" representing all files not beginning with "." is assumed. 
# The syntax "~user" is understood.  Non-absolute pathnames are relative to the directory `regutil
# regpath{PQACT_DATADIR_PATH}`.
#
# A hash in column one indicates a comment line.
