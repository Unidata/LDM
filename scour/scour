# Deletes old data files.
#
# Recursively deletes files older than a specified number of days from a
# specified set of directories.  The directories, retention time in days,
# and an optional shell filename pattern appear, separated by tab characters
# one directory per line, in a configuration file named on the command line.
#
# If no files have been written under a directory since the last time scour was
# run, it will skip deleting old files and log an error message instead.
#
# WARNING: scour follows symbolic links, so don't put symbolic links to
# directories you don't want scoured under data directories.
