.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
This program creates a LDM product queue (see \fBpq\fP(3)).  A
product queue is currently implemented as a memory-mapped file, and hence
should be created on a disk local to the host on which programs sharing the
product queue will be run.  The current release of the queue software
does not allow the queue to grow, so this program must be used to create
a (fixed size) queue of adequate size prior to running any of the LDM programs.
.LP
The current queue implementation file format has 3 parts, a fixed size
header, a data section, and a control or index section. The size of the
data section is specified by the \fB-s\fP option. The index section is
parameterized by the number of product "slots" available. This is set by
the \fB-S\fP option.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B -v
Verbose output.  A line is output on queue creation that confirms the queue
of the specified size was successfully created.  The default is not to
output such a message.
.TP
.BI "-c "
Used to clobber an existing product queue with the same pathname, if it
already exists, before creating a new product queue.  If this option is not
specified, the program will exit with an error message when requested to
create a product queue that already exists.  If processes that insert data
into a product queue are terminated ungracefully (for example as the result
of a system crash), the leftover queue may be corrupt and hence should be
clobbered when the LDM is restarted.
.TP
.BI \-s " size"
Specifies the requested size, in bytes, of the data portion of the product 
queue.
This "option" is required.
If the last character of \fIsize\fP is a (case insensitive) `K', `M', or G',
then the preceeding numeric value specifies
kilobytes, megabytes, or gigabytes, respectively.
A larger product queue can hold more or
larger data products and hence deal with longer network outages to
downstream data sinks or with slow decoders.
The actual size of the 
data portion of the product queue might be slightly greater than the requested
size for performance reasons.
.TP
.BI \-S " nproducts"
This option specifies the number of product slots available in the index
section of the queue file. If unspecified, the number of slots will be 
the option-argument of the \fB-s\fP option divided by an assumed
average product size -- \fBwhich is guaranteed to be incorrect\fP.
.TP
.BI \-q " pqfname"
The name of the product queue file.  The default is
.nh
\fB@LDM_QUEUE_PATH@\fP.
.hy
This should specify a local file, not a remotely mounted file.
.TP
.BI "-f "
Fast option, to create a product queue quickly without allocating all
the disk blocks it requires.  This creates a sparse file with mostly
zero blocks that occupy no space on disk until they are written.  This
is not the default because it permits creating a product queue larger
than the available disk space, or larger than the space that will be
available at some later time.
This option should only be used if you know there will be enough disk space
for the product queue when it is full.

.SH EXAMPLE

The following invocation will create a product queue of 50 Mbytes in
\fB/usr/local/ldm/data/ldm.pq\fP:

.RS +4
  pqcreate -s 50M -q /usr/local/ldm/data/ldm.pq
