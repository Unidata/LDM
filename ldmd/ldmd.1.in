.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This program is the LDM server. 
.PP
The LDM server performs several functions:
.sp
.RS 4
.TP 3
1)
It starts up the programs which
access a local product queue (see \fBpq(3)\fP). These are specified
by the "exec" entries in the configuration file. It serves as the
process group leader for these programs and specialized copies of
itself.
.TP
2)
It forks processes which request and then receive data from
other LDM servers. The data received is placed in the product
queue and the local programs are notified. This function is
controlled by the "request" entries in the configuration file.
.TP
3)
It compiles access control information from the configuration file.
These are the "accept" (input) and "allow" (output) entries.
They are used to determine which hosts can request what services
from this server.
.TP
4)
It registers a TCP RPC service for version 5 and version 6 of the
protocol. It listens for connections, performs access control
similar to \fBtcpd\fP and forks to service requests on that connection.
.PP

.TP
\fIconf_filename\fP is the pathname of the configuration file.  The default
is printed by the command "regutil regpath{LDMD_CONFIG_PATH}".
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI "-I " IP_addr
IP address of network interface to use.  The default is printed by the
command "regutil regpath{IP_ADDR}".
.TP
.BI \-l " logdest"
Log to \fIlogdest\fP. One of \fB''\fP (system logging daemon), \fB'-'\fP
(standard error stream), or file \fIlogdest\fP. If the standard error stream is
specified, then the process will not daemonize itself. Default is the standard
error stream if the process has a controlling terminal (i.e., the process isn't
a daemon); otherwise, log messages will be sent to either the LDM log file or
the system logging daemon (execute this program with just the option \fB'-?'\fP
to determine which).
.TP
.BI "-M " max_clients
The maximum number of clients allowed to connect to the LDM server before
additional connections are rejected.  The default is printed by the command
"regutil regpath{MAX_CLIENTS}".
.TP
.BI "-m " max_latency
\fBFor connections using LDM 5 protocols only.\fP
Receipt of a product older than \fImax_latency\fP (plus \fIrpctimeo\fP)
seconds triggers a RECLASS response, which generally causes the
sender to skip ahead in it's queue. If \fItoffset\fP was specified, then
the "from" time of the RECLASS response is \fItoffset\fP seconds before now,
otherwise, \fImax_latency\fP is used.  The default is printed by the
command "regutil regpath{MAX_LATENCY}".
.TP
.BI "-n"
Do nothing other than check the invocation arguments and check the
configuration-file for errors.
.TP
.BI "-o " toffset
No products older than \fItoffset\fP seconds are requested.
The default is printed by the command "regutil regpath{TIME_OFFSET}".
The value of \fItoffset\fP should be less than or equal to \fImax_latency\fP.
.TP
.BI "-P " port
Port on the remote host on which to connect.  The default is printed by the
command "regutil regpath{PORT}".
The well-known LDM port is 388.
.TP
.BI "-q " pqfname
Set the pathname of the data product queue to \fIpqfname\fP.
The default is printed by the command "regutil regpath{QUEUE_PATH}".
As a convenience, the process group leader sets the environment
variable \fBLDMPQFNAME\fP to this value, overriding the default in
cooperative children.
.TP
.BI "-t " rpctimeo
Sets the timeout for LDM 5 remote procedure calls to \fIrpctimeo\fP seconds.
.TP
.B -v
Verbose logging.
Informative messages (level \fBLOG_INFO\fP) are logged.
By default, only messages of severity \fBLOG_NOTICE\fP and greater are
logged. Incoming products are logged as they are received.
.TP
.B -x
Debug logging.
Debugging messages (level \fBLOG_DEBUG\fP) are logged.
At least three times the output of verbose logging. A message
is printed for each RPC transaction (except NULLPROC). In
particular, the progress of incoming products is may be monitored.
The MD5 checksum of each product is printed.
.TP
.B -y
Use logging timestamps with microsecond resolution. The default is
second resolution.
.TP
.B -z
Use logging timestamps formatted according to the ISO 8601 standard
(e.g.
.IR YYYYMMDD T hhmmss ).
The default is
.IR Mon\ day\ hh : mm : ss
.SH SIGNALS
.TP
.BR SIGTERM
Normal termination. If sent to the process group leader,
it forwards the signal to the process group
and waits termination of all the children.
.BR SIGINT
Slightly expedited termination. If sent to the process group leader,
it still sends SIGTERM to the process group and waits. Caution: killing
receivers with SIGINT or SIGKILL (-9) can result in queue corruption.
.TP
.B SIGUSR2
Cyclically increment the verbosity of the program. Assumming the program was
started without the \fB-v\fP or \fB-x\fP switches, the first \fBSIGUSR2\fP will
make it verbose and \fBLOG_INFO\fP priority messages will appear.
The second will turn on the \fBLOG_DEBUG\fP priority messages as well.
A third will take it back to the normal state.
