<p>
One of the NWS Family of Services (FOS) data streams, HDS is primarily
comprised of binary products containing centrally generated analysis and
forecast fields in binary formats such as GRIB.
</p>

<p>
</p><ul>
  <li> <a href="http://www.nws.noaa.gov/pub/msgdist/hds.txt"><b>WMO 
	headers</b></a> for current HDS products 
  </li><li> Currently from the IDD, this stream contains more than just the
       HDS products, because it is generated from the binary NOAAPORT
       NWSTG products.  Thus it also includes profiler data in WMO
       BUFR format, and other binary products.
  </li><li> Daily volume: about 1.3 GBytes in 126000 products
  </li><li> Use of this feedtype will be deprecated after a transition to
       the NOAAport NGRID feedtype.
