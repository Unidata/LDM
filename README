INTRODUCTION:

    This package contains the source-code for the Unidata Program Center's Local
    Data Manager (LDM).

RELEASE IDENTIFICATION:

    The release identifier for this package is in the file VERSION and has the
    following form:

        <major>.<minor>.<rev>

    where:

        <major>     Is the major release-number (e.g., 6).  Changes to this
                    component indicate a major departure from previous releases
                    (such as a change to the LDM protocol).  Such changes are
                    often not compatible with previous releases.

        <minor>     Is the minor release-number (e.g., 1).  Changes to this
                    component indicate the addition of new features.  The
                    package remains compatible with previous releases having the
                    same major release-number.

        <rev>       Is the revision-level (e.g., 0).  Changes to this component
                    indicate bug-fixes and/or performance improvments that are
                    functionally compatible with previous releases having the
                    same major and minor release-numbers.
