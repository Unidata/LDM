<h2 align="center">The Unidata LDM and Network Security</h2>
<p align="justify">In order to receive data in near real time the LDM requires round the clock 
  Internet connectivity. With the ever increasing risk of computer break ins, 
  it is understandable that system administrators feel the need to restrict access 
  as much as possible. This page describes the security situation of the
  LDM. </p>

<p><strong>To the best of our knowledge (and we should know) no computer system
has ever been compromised via the LDM since it was first released in
1994.</strong>

<h3>General LDM Information</h3>
<p align="justify">Like FTP and HTTP, the LDM uses a reserved port. Unidata has 
  registered with <a
href="http://www.iana.org/"><b>IANA</b></a> to 
  use reserved port 388. (For more information on port numbers see <a
href="http://www.iana.org/numbers.html"> <b>IANA's 
  Protocol Numbers and Assignment Services</b></a> and search for "Port Numbers".) 
</p>
<p align="justify">
Under UNIX it is necessary to have root level privileges in order to
acquire a reserved port.  For this reason the LDM server, the parent
<code>ldmd</code> process, temporarily becomes 'root' when opening and closing the port.
At all other times, it has the reduced privileges of the LDM user.
Similarly, all child processes are owned by the LDM user and thus do not have
root privileges.
(The LDM should always be invoked by the LDM user and never by 'root'.)
In order to implement this, LDM installation requires root
privileges to set the user id of <code>ldmd</code> to root and to set the
SUID bit.
</p>
<p align="justify">Also, like FTP and HTTP, network communication between LDMs 
  occurs via a limited, well-defined protocol. That protocol is defined in the 
  file <code>ldm.h</code> which comes with the source code distribution. If you 
  would like to read more about the protocol, please see the section
  entitled <a href="basics/protocol.html">The LDM 6 Protocol</a>
  in the
  <a href="basics/">LDM Reference</a> webpages.
</p>
<p align="justify">
The only other purpose for which the LDM might need root privileges is to
implement logging. LDM version 6.12 and earlier use the system logging daemon.
LDM version 6.13 and later can be built to use the system logging daemon.
Such logging is initiated via the
<code>hupsyslog</code> program, which sends a HUP
signal to the system logging daemon (e.g., <code>syslogd</code>,
<code>rsyslogd</code>).
This can only be done if the <code>hupsyslog</code> process is owned by root.
When the system logging daemon receives a HUP, it closes all files it has open
and rereads its configuration file. <code>hupsyslog</code> is always
called upon LDM start-up, and is typically run periodically to rotate the
log files.
</p>
<p align="justify">The LDM makes one more bow to security. It requires a reverse lookup of the 
  client host name. That is, when a client connects to an LDM server, the server 
  will confirm that the client's fully qualified domain name (FQDN) resolves to 
  an IP address, and that that IP address resolves to the same FQDN. For this 
  reason, the LDM may not work if a client is using an alias and relevant tables 
  aren't properly updated or a new name has not yet propagated to the relevant 
  name servers. </p>

<p align="justify">Because the top-level LDM server immediately
daemonizes itself, it is not possible for an outside entity to obtain a
user shell by crashing the LDM (even if such a thing were possible).

<h3> Access Control and Access to Port 388</h3>

<p align="justify">When the LDM was designed it was necessary for it to perform its own access 
  control. This is implemented in the form of <code>ALLOW</code> entries in the 
  configuration file <code>ldmd.conf</code>. In that file, <code>ALLOW</code> entries 
  specify hosts that may connect to the localhost to receive data. Subnet
  regular expressions may 
  be used as host names. The LDM will deny a connection from any host that is 
  not allowed to connect. </p>
<p align="justify">
Use of the LDM requires that any host listed in its access control list be
allowed a TCP connection to port 388 on the localhost.
If the localhost is behind a firewall, the firewall <em>must</em> allow TCP access
to port 388.
</p>

<p align="justify">The LDM does not use TCP-Wrappers. Nor is it spawned by <code>inetd</code>, 
so TCP-Wrappers provide no benefit with respect to the use of port 388. </p>

<h3> The Portmapper </h3>
<p align="justify">
The LDM does not require that the portmapper program (usually called
<code>portmap</code> or <code>rcpbind</code>) be running on
the host system.  If it is running, however, then the LDM will
register its remote procedure call (RPC) service.
The portmapper is not required by downstream LDMs because they
will attempt to connect directly to port 388.  Only if they cannot connect
via this port will they then try to use the portmapper.
