<h2>What is the LDM?</h2>

<p>The LDM is a distributed software system for efficiently and
reliably distributing arbitrary but finite-size data-products via 
the Internet.  It provides mechanisms to
inject, request, receive, relay, and locally process data-products.
These mechanisms are event-driven, which means that things are done 
with the data-products as soon as possible.

<p>
See
<a href="../basics/data-product.html">
LDM Reference: LDM Data-Product</a> for more information on data-products.

<p>The LDM system also provides mechanisms for the local disposition of
data-products -- typically by being processed on the host
computer.
See the <em>Actions</em> section in
<a href="../basics/pqact.conf.html">
LDM Reference: pqact.conf
</a>
for information on the types of things that can be done with a
data product.

See
<a href="../basics/generic-LDM.html">
LDM Reference: Runtime Structure of a Generic LDM System
</a>
for a diagram and description of the structure of a generic LDM
system.

<h2>What do I need to run the LDM?</h2>

<p>The LDM was designed to run under the UNIX<sup>�</sup> operating
system.  As a consequence, it cannot, in general, run on a 
Windows<sup>�</sup> system.

<p>Aside from that, the LDM system is designed to be fairly portable
amongst the various flavors of UNIX<sup>�</sup>.  The specifics can
