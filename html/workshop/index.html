    <p>We want your feedback on how to improve this workshop and also (if you don't mind) information on how you use the
      LDM or intend to use it -- so we can justify its continuing existence. Please go to
      <a href="https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/community/surveys/2012training/survey.html">

    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to the 2012 Training Workshop on the Unidata LDM!</p>
    <p>Your instructor is Steve Emmerson, co-developer of LDM 4, developer of LDM 6, and author of this workshop.</p>
    <p>When you finish this class, you should be able to install, configure, and manage an LDM system or network of LDM
      systems at your home site. You might even do that remotely during the class itself.</p>

    <h2 id="schedule">Schedule</h2>
    <p>The approximate schedule for the LDM workshop is</p>
    <table>
      <tr>

    <p>If we finish early, then we'll have time to examine the LDM installation at your site and upgrade it if you
      wish.</p>

    <h2 id="tutorial">Tutorial</h2>
    <p>Because the LDM is designed to run on many different flavors of UNIX and because each site will probably use the
      LDM in different ways, the LDM Tutorial is designed to be a general tutorial -- covering all aspects of the LDM
      while omitting operating-system-specific and site-specific details. As a consequence, the tutorial must be
      customized to reflect the specific circumstances of this workshop. This is done by embedding hyperlinks like the
      following in the tutorial at appropriate locations:</p>
    <p><a href="specifics.html">Workshop-specific instructions</a></p>
    <p>Please follow these hyperlinks when appropriate.</p>
    <p>And now, the general <a href="../tutorial/index.html">LDM Tutorial</a>.</p>
