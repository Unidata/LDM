<h2 align="center">Building the LP64 version of LDM for huge product queues</h2>

<p align="justify">On platforms that support a compilation environment for C where ints are 32 
  bits but longs and pointers are 64 bits (the LP64 model), it is possible to 
  build the LDM programs to support huge product queues (larger than 2 Gbytes). 
  This document includes instructions for building the LDM programs on such 64-bit 
  platforms.</p>
<p align="justify">

In general you cannot mix 64-bit LDM programs built for use with huge
product queues with 32-bit LDM programs built for queues limited to 2
Gbytes in size.  The formats of the two kinds of queues are
incompatible.</p>

<h3>Solaris 7 and 8 (SunOS 5.7, 5.8) for SPARCv9 architectures</h3>

<p align="justify">This will only work on SPARCv9 or later hardware architectures, and in particular 
  not on SPARCv7, SPARCv8, or Intel. To check what architecture your platform 
  uses, invoke </p>
<pre>
  isainfo -n
</pre>
<p align="justify">Next, make sure the Sun package <strong>SUNWscpux</strong> is installed, which 
  provides utilities for user interface and source build compatibility with SunOS 
  4.x, and in particular the library /usr/ucblib/sparcv9/librpcsoc.so which is 
  necessary to build a 64-bit version of the LDM. You can either check for that 
  library or check for the package installation with the command </p>
<pre>
  pkginfo -l SUNWscpux
</pre>
<p align="justify">In order to use this library you need to make a change to the LDM src/configure 
  script. Since this is somewhat of an exceptional case, we recommend that you 
  copy the script to another name in the src directory, say, configure.sparcv9. 
  Then edit the configure.sparcv9 script to replace the line </p>
<pre>
		*)  libs="-R/usr/ucblib -L/usr/ucblib -lrpcsoc -lnsl"
</pre>
with
<pre>
		*)  libs="-R/usr/ucblib/sparcv9 -L/usr/ucblib/sparcv9 -lrpcsoc -lnsl"
</pre>
<p align="justify">

Before actually running the configure.sparcv9 script, you must make sure
"-xarch=v9" is included in the CFLAGS environment variable.  For
example, 
<blockquote><pre>
export CFLAGS=-xarch=v9
</blockquote></pre>
</p>
<p>When the installation instructions tell you to execute the 
<b><tt>configure</b></tt>
script, execute <b><tt>configure.sparcv9</tt></b> instead.

<h3>IRIX64</h3>

Just include the "-64" option in CFLAGS before running the configure
script to generate a huge queue version of the LDM programs for
IRIX64.
