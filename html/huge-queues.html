    <h1>Building the LP64 version of LDM for huge product queues</h1>
    <p>On platforms that support a compilation environment for C where ints are 32 bits but longs and pointers are 64
      bits (the LP64 model), it is possible to build the LDM programs to support huge product queues (larger than
      2 Gbytes). This document includes instructions for building the LDM programs on such 64-bit platforms.</p>
    <p>In general you cannot mix 64-bit LDM programs built for use with huge product queues with 32-bit LDM programs
      built for queues limited to 2 Gbytes in size.  The formats of the two kinds of queues are incompatible.</p>

    <h2>Solaris 7 and 8 (SunOS 5.7, 5.8) for SPARCv9 architectures</h2>
    <p>This will only work on SPARCv9 or later hardware architectures, and in particular not on SPARCv7, SPARCv8, or
      Intel. To check what architecture your platform  uses, invoke </p>
    <pre>
      isainfo -n
    </pre>
    <p>Next, make sure the Sun package <b>SUNWscpux</b> is installed, which provides utilities for user interface and
      source build compatibility with SunOS 4.x, and in particular the library /usr/ucblib/sparcv9/librpcsoc.so which
      is necessary to build a 64-bit version of the LDM. You can either check for that library or check for the package
      installation with the command</p>
    <pre>
      pkginfo -l SUNWscpux
    </pre>
    <p>In order to use this library you need to make a change to the LDM src/configure script. Since this is somewhat of
      an exceptional case, we recommend that you copy the script to another name in the src directory, say,
      configure.sparcv9. Then edit the configure.sparcv9 script to replace the line </p>
    <pre>
		  *)  libs="-R/usr/ucblib -L/usr/ucblib -lrpcsoc -lnsl"
    </pre>
    with
    <pre>
		  *)  libs="-R/usr/ucblib/sparcv9 -L/usr/ucblib/sparcv9 -lrpcsoc -lnsl"
    </pre>
    <p>Before actually running the configure.sparcv9 script, you must make sure "-xarch=v9" is included in the CFLAGS
      environment variable.  For example,</p>
    <pre>
      export CFLAGS=-xarch=v9
    </pre>
    <p>When the installation instructions tell you to execute the <b>configure</b> script, execute
      <b>configure.sparcv9</b> instead.</p>

    <h2>IRIX64</h2>
    <p>Just include the "-64" option in CFLAGS before running the configure script to generate a huge queue version of
      the LDM programs for IRIX64.</p>
