    <h1>Packetshaper and the LDM</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
     <p> Recently a few of our sites experienced data reception that was severely throttled or stopped for no apparent 
      reason. Symptoms were inconsistent and somewhat sporadic  and included: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>extremely low throughput</li>
      <li>latency problems </li>
      <li>RPC time outs </li>
      <li>"can't contact portmapper" messages</li>
      <li>"no route to host" messages</li>
      <li>ldmping failure, usually due to RPC time out</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In some cases a subset of products got through, but in other cases nothing got through.</p>
    <p>We determined that Packetshaper had been installed at these sites. Packetshaper is a product developed by
      Packeteer to analyze and 	"shape" network traffic. It is often used to limit traffic from low priority
      applications. Packetshaper is a box that generally sits between a router and switch.  Thus, there's no way to
      tell whether it's running except to ask your network administrator.</p>
    <p>Packetshaper can discriminate traffic based on port number, IP address,  application, protocol, subnet, URL, and
      other criteria. But if it's mis-configured, LDM traffic can be adversely affected.</p>
    <p>If you determine that Packetshaper is running at your site, perhaps the easiest way to determine if it is
      affecting your data	flow is to ask your network engineer to turn it off for 30 minutes.  If your data reception
      quickly	improves, it's reasonable to assume that Packetshaper was not	properly configured.  With technical help
      from Packeteer, we are providing the instructions below for configuring Packetshaper to allow LDM traffic
      to flow.</p>
    <p><b>Note</b>: when buying Packetshaper, sites have an option to purchase    support.  Please check to see if your
      contract includes support. If you have support, you should use that, as these  pages may become outdated. </p>
    <p><b>Note</b>: Technical support at Packeteer recommends that the Packetshaper be upgraded to the current software
      version, 5.2.2 if they have not done so already.  Performance of the rate policies is improved over previous
      versions. Also, Packeteer is regularly  adding applications to the "autodiscover" process, which are made
      available via upgrades.</p>

    <h2>Configuring Packetshaper to Handle LDM Traffic</h2>
    <h3>Isolating LDM Traffic for Configuration Purposes</h3>
    <p>To isolate this traffic it will be necessary to create two classes  to capture traffic on this port. One will be
      an inbound class, the other will be outbound. For each class we will </p>
    <ol>
      <li>assign rules for "catching" traffic</li>
      <li>assign a priority</li>
      <li>reserve a portion of bandwidth for LDM traffic</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Creating the Inbound Class and Assigning Rules</h3>
    <p>Each class, both inbound and outbound, will contain two matching rules.  One rule will match the ports
      "inside:any" and "outside:388".  The other rule will match ports "inside:388" and  "outside:any".  This will allow
      us to catch traffic on port 388 on either side regardless of whether the machine is a server or client.
      (Technically, an LDM site can switch roles, so that at any	time it may be either a client or a server.)</p>
    <p>To create the inbound class, first click the "/Inbound" folder in the left frame.  This will take you to the
      manage page for the root /inbound folder. Click the "class" button, then "add" in the dropdown menu.  This will
      take you to the page shown here:</p>
    <p><img src='newclass2.gif' alt="New Class"/></p>
    <p>First, name the class.</p>
    <p>Next, we will specify two rules for the class. When creating a new traffic class, the Packetshaper automatically
      adds at least one matching rule. For the first rule,  choose location "any", then specify an inside port of "any"
      and an outside port of "388".  All other fields are left as their defaults.  Click "add class".</p>
    <p>To add the second rule, return to the manage page, click the "class" button once again, then "add matching rule".
      This will take you to a class which is identical to the newclass page, except it will be missing the class name.
      Add another rule that will match ports "inside:388" "outside:any". Click "add rule" and the class is complete.</p>
    <p>This now takes us to the manage page for the LDM class:</p>
    <p><img src="manageLDM.gif" alt="Manage LDM"/></p>
    <p>Choose Type: "Exception" then "Apply Changes".  The Packetshaper classifies traffic from top to bottom, so this
      will move the class toward the top of the tree.</p>

    <h3>Giving the LDM Inbound Class a High Priority</h3>
    <p>All classes get priority 3 by default. To prioritize this traffic one can give it a higher rate policy. First,
      on the manage page for the class, click  the "Policy" button then "add" to get the following page: </p>
    <p><img src="addpolicy.gif" alt="Add Policy"/></p>
    <p>On this screen you can choose to add either a rate policy, or a priority policy. The page Selecting and Using
      Policies describes the differences between both types of policies and when it is appropriate to use each type.
      For the LDM, it is recommended that you set a rate policy because this allows reservation of bandwidth. Packeteer
      technical support recommends setting the rate policy to Priority 5. Although Priority 7 is the highest, very high
      rate policies should be used with caution because they tend to starve those traffic types with lower-priority
      policies if the traffic type is persistent and particularly aggressive. A rate 5 is usually sufficient. </p>
    <p>With a rate policy you are required to fill out several fields.  First, enter 0 for "Guaranteed". Check the
      "burstable" box, then choose Priority 5 from the dropdown menu.  Upper limit should be left blank.  Click "add
      policy" to complete the process. </p>

    <h3>Reserving Bandwidth for the LDM Inbound Class</h3>
    <p>There is also an option to add a bandwidth partition for the class.  The most important difference between a
      policy and a partition is that a policy will work on individual flows, while a partition will work on the
      aggregate of all flows within the partition.  So if a traffic type is particularly delay sensitive it is usually
      a good idea to guarantee some bandwidth to the class as a whole.   </p>
    <p>To add a partition go to the manage page for the class and click on	"partition" (and then "add"?) to get this
      window:</p>
    <p><img src="addpart.gif" alt="Add Part"/></p>
    <p>The "size" specifies the reserved bandwidth for this traffic type.  This can remain fixed by unchecking the
      "burstable" box, or a "limit" can be specified up to which it can burst. If the upper limit is left blank, the
      traffic will be allowed to burst up to the link rate.  Otherwise, it will be capped.  Click "add partition" to
      complete the process.  In this example, all LDM traffic is guaranteed 200k.  It will not compete for these 200k
      with any other traffic types but if LDM does not need all 200k, the remaining bandwidth will be available to
      classes outside the partition.  When it reaches 200k, if it needs more bandwidth, then it will receive it based
      on the policy on the class.  In this case it is a rate policy with 0 guaranteed, and burstable at priority 5.</p>
    <p>(If you would like help in estimating the volume of data to your site, please send email to
      support@unidata.ucar.edu.  Please include the 'request' lines from your ldmd.conf file.)</p>
    <p>This completes the class in the /Inbound folder.</p>

    <h3>Creating the LDM Outbound Class</h3>
    <p>Now to duplicate the inbound class in the /Outbound folder, simply click the "class" button once again, choose
      "copy" then choose "Outbound/" for the destination.  This will copy the class along with any policies and
      partitions to the /outbound folder.</p>

    <h2>Testing the Connection</h2>
    <p>This is an image of the Traffic Test screen:</p>
    <p><img src="traffictest.gif" alt="Traffic Test"/></p>
    <p>To get to this screen click the "Manage" tab, then the "traffic class test"  button on the upper right side.
        You will then get the screen in the image. </p>
    <p>To test, enter the server port number 388 then click "test".  This will list the traffic class which is currently
      classifying this traffic.  You can also test for both directions of traffic flow, Inbound and Outbound to make
      doubly sure.  Most likely, it will be going to DiscoveredPorts/TCP_Port_388.</p>
    <p>Thanks and appreciation to Andres Escalera from Packeteer for his assistance in providing these instructions and
      the screen images.</p>
