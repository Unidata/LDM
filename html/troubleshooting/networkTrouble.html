    <h1>Missing Data and Latency Problems</h1>
    <p>Sometimes a site will be running a correctly configured LDM and yet not be receiving all requested data.  Or a
     site may receive data correctly most of the time but also experience possibly recurring episodes of missing data.
     Such symptoms often indicate network problems.  Network problems are difficult because frequently there is very
     little control over them.  This page is to help you diagnose and possibly treat these problems.</p>
    <p>First, it is important that LDM site managers develop a good relationship with their system administrators.
      System administrators are among the best suited people to assist with network problems. Furthermore, if your site
      is a data relay site, it is important that these people be aware of the role that you are playing so that they can
      consider this when making changes affecting the network.</p>
    <p>The LDM tries to deal with the problem of network congestion. In particular, if a product doesn't make it to its
      destination site, the upstream LDM will try to re-send it. This will continue until the product is successfully
      sent, or it becomes too old (over an hour, by default), or some other disabling event occurs such as a machine or
      network connection going down. Due to the fewer number of packets, it is more likely for a low-volume stream to be
      successfully transmitted than a high-volume stream.</p>

    <h2>Missing Data Upon LDM Start-Up</h2>
    <p>Missing data is not uncommon when stopping and starting an LDM. This is because upon LDM start-up the upstream
      and downstream sites must reestablish which products should be sent to the downstream site. Then products must be
      transferred, including a possible backlog of products that accumulated while the site was down.</p>
    <p>We can break down this situation into three cases. First, if an LDM is down for just a brief time, say, a few
     minutes, it is possible that no data will be lost. Second, if an LDM is down for between a few minutes and one
     hour, data may or may not be lost, depending on whether the upstream and downstream site can reestablish which
     products should be sent and transfer the backlog of products in a timely manner. Third, if an LDM is down for over
     one hour, products over one hour old will be lost because data at the upstream site is, by default, expired after
     one hour. The success of transfer of products less than one hour old is the same as in the second case.</p>
    <p>In any of these cases, the system should eventually be able to catch up and the problem of missing data should 
      disappear. If it doesn't, the next two steps are to (1) evaluate your upstream feed then (2) evaluate the 
      connection to your upstream feed.</p>

    <h2>Evaluating Your Upstream Feed</h2>
    <p>If you notice missing data, it may be due to a problem at your upstream feed. Here are a few tools to help 
      determine if your upstream site is actually up, if the LDM is running on that site, if it is receiving data, and 
      if it is configured to send data to your downstream site.</p>
    <p>Note that <b>man pages are available for all the commands listed in this section and the following section</b>. 
      Be sure to check the man pages for detailed information about command options and output.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>ping</b> - This is a UNIX command. It sends a continuous stream of small packets to the named host, so that 
        you can watch the quality of the connection over time. Upon completion, it gives a few summarizing statistics. 
        With <b>ping</b> you can see if a site is connected and responding. It also gives some indication of network 
        delays and packet delivery reliability. </li>
      <li>Example: <b>ping <i>host_name</i></b>. Note that by default <b>ping</b> only sends very small packets. The 
        reliability of transmission of larger packets may be different. See the man page for info regarding how to 
        change the packet size.</li>
	    <li><b>ldmping</b> - This is an LDM command. It checks to see if an LDM server is running on a remote host. It does 
       not require the 'ping'ing site to be on the access control list of the upstream LDM (unlike <b>notifyme</b>, 
       below), and thus can be used on any host. It should return the string "RESPONDING" in the state field. If it 
       doesn't, check the man page to see what the state means. </li>
      <li> Example: <b>ldmping -i 5 -h <i>host_name</i></b> to ping every five seconds. Since network traffic varies 
        over time, it can be useful to either run <b>ldmping</b> for a while, say 1/2 hour, or use it to sample at a 
        variety of times. </li>
	    <li><b>notifyme</b> - This is an LDM command to see if upstream host is receiving data. The remote host must have 
        an 'allow' line for your site in the ldmd.conf file, so it also ensures that the upstream site is configured 
        properly to send you products. </li>
      <li>Example: <b>notifyme -vl - -h <i>host_name</i></b>.  <b>notifyme</b> returns (1) the current system time, (2) 
        the string 'notifyme', (3) the product size, (4) the time the product was injected into the IDD, (5) the feed 
        type, (6) a sequence number, and (7) the product ID with the actual product time. If you take the difference 
        between the first and fourth  fields, you can see how long it took the product to arrive at the host.</li> 
    </ul>
    <p>Although these are ways for you to get some information regarding your upstream feed, there is no way for you to 
      determine what 'allow' entries your upstream feed has in its ldmd.conf file for your site. Thus, your upstream 
      feed may be getting the data you want, but it may not be configured properly to send it to you. If you have ruled 
      out network congestion (see below) and suspect this is the case, contact your upstream site. </p>

    <h2>Evaluating the Connection to Your Upstream Site</h2>
    <p>If your upstream site is up but you have missing data, then you may have network congestion problems. If, at this 
      point you suspect network congestion, take a look at the log. Execute the command: <code>ldmadmin log</code>. If 
      high latency is occurring, the downstream LDM log will contain messages similar to the following exchange between 
      the upstream site 'rainbow' and the downstream site 'shadow': </p>
    <pre>
      > Nov 14 20:53:13 shadow rainbow[15060]:
      >       RECLASS: 19971114195313.567 TS_ENDT
      >                {{DDPLUS,  ".*"},{IDS,  ".*"},{HDS,  ".*"}}
      > Nov 14 20:53:13 shadow rainbow[15060]:
      >        skipped: 19971114195019.062 (174.505 seconds)
      > Nov 14 20:58:29 shadow rainbow[15060]:
      >       RECLASS: 19971114195829.792 TS_ENDT
      >               {{DDPLUS,  ".*"},{IDS,  ".*"},{HDS,  ".*"}}
      > Nov 14 20:58:29 shadow rainbow[15060]:
      >       skipped: 19971114195339.392 (290.400 seconds)
      > Nov 14 21:04:06 shadow rainbow[15060]:
      >       RECLASS: 19971114200406.219 TS_ENDT
      >               {{DDPLUS,  ".*"},{IDS,  ".*"},{HDS,  ".*"}}
      > Nov 14 21:04:06 shadow rainbow[15060]:
      >       skipped: 19971114195920.680 (285.539 seconds)
    </pre>
    <p>In this case the RECLASS message means that rainbow has sent shadow data that is older than shadow wishes to
      accept. Shadow responded by sending the upstream site the RECLASS message. The purpose of the RECLASS message is 
      to reestablish which products should actually be sent, including information about the desired time ranges. Also, 
      the 'skipped' entries indicate that shadow is throwing away the old products it received.</p>
    <p>For more information on the RECLASS and 'skipped' messages, click <a href="reclassDoc.html">here</a>.</p>
    <p>Here are a few tools to help in evaluating the quality of the connectivity to your upstream site:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>traceroute</b> - Use this UNIX command to identify the route through which information flows from one host 
        to another. It will also show where slow links are located. After using traceroute to determine the intermediate 
        hops between your machine and the destination machine, you can use ping to test where a source of packet loss 
        may be located.</li>
      <li>Example: <b> traceroute <i>host_name</i></b>. <b>traceroute</b> picks a path to the named host, then, by 
        default, sends three probes to each gateway along the path. Each line of output displays the timing results of 
        these three probes. By default, timing results greater than five seconds are reported by displaying a '*' for 
        that probe. See the man page for more information and changing default values. </li>
      <li><b>ftp</b> - This is the UNIX file transfer utility. Grabbing a junk file can give you another perspective of 
        the degree of network congestion. This requires that you know of, and have access to, a file to transfer.</li>
      <li>Example: <b> ftp <i>host_name</i></b>, then follow the protocol to transfer a file.</li>
      <li><b>netcheck</b> - This LDM command is also a perl script that combines traceroute and ping.  This can be run 
        as a cron job to monitor the network  over time. Example: <b>netcheck</b></li>
    </ul>

   <h2>Options</h2>
    <p>Once network congestion has been confirmed, only a limited set of options are available. Here at the UPC we can
      make some changes in the IDD topology based on empirical knowledge of the network. However, this solution can be
      labor-intensive and is limited due to site resources.</p>
    <p>If your network connection is bad, you will need to show the problem to your system administrator or ISP. The
      submission of the network problem must come from the customer, so the UPC cannot submit the request on your
      behalf. Since network problems can be intermittent, it's important to get your system administrator or ISP
      involved when you can actually show them the problem.</p>
    <p>You can increase the '-m max_latency' parameter to ldmd(1) to allow the upstream site more time to deliver. You
      would have to increase your queue size proportionately. Of course, this really won't do much good unless the
      upstream site has a correspondingly large product-queue. Otherwise, the products will be garbage-collected before
      they are able to send. This would allow you to get the data, albeit in a less timely manner. <i>This is not a
        great solution.</i></p>
    <p>Another thing you can try is to split the feed requests of your LDM so that multiple connections are used. For
      example, in <b>etc/ldmd.conf</b> change
    <pre>
      request DDPLUS|IDS|HDS  ".*"    rainbow.eas.purdue.edu
    </pre>
    <p>to</p>
    <pre>
      request DDPLUS  ".*"    rainbow.eas.purdue.edu
      request IDS     ".*"    rainbow.eas.purdue.edu
      request HDS     ".*"    rainbow.eas.purdue.edu
    </pre>
    <p>Because of the multiple entries, the LDM will fork off a separate process and, thus, a separate connection for
      the three feeds.  The parallel connections sometimes result in greater throughput.</p>
    <p>In the long run, however, you may need to ask for less data or get a fatter pipe. It is worth considering
      whether you can get by with less data. Sites often request more data than they actually use. Or, NSF provides
      grants for equipment that might include hardware to upgrade network connections.  Such grants are announced on the
      <a href="https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/"><b>UPC</b> homepage</a>.  You can also see
      <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=nsf0051"><b>an old announcement</b></a> from the
      NSF for more information.</p>
    <p>A last resort would be to purchase or build your own direct satellite receiver system for acquiring NOAAport
      data and feeding these data  to your LDM. Some required components include: a satellite antenna, an ingest card,
      a PC, some software, and a demodulator for each channel desired. Contact
      <a href="mailto:support@unidata.ucar.edu"> support@unidata.ucar.edu</a> for more information. This option will
      not help with non-NOAAPORT data feeds, such as NIDS or NLDN.</p>
