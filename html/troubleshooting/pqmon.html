<H2 align="center">Tuning product queue parameters with pqmon</H2>
<br>
<p align="justify"> What size product queue should you create to hold an hour's worth
of data?  This depends on what data feeds you are subscribing to as
well as the changing contents of the data streams.  The number of
products and the aggregate amount of data for each feed type may
change over time.  The LDM program <strong>pqmon</strong>, available
with version 5.1.1 and later releases, may be useful for helping to
determine what size queue to create, whether your current queue size
is adequate, or whether you are wasting space in the queue with many
unused product slots.  </p>

<p align="justify"> The <strong>pqmon</strong> program monitors the state of a product
queue, including the number of products currently in the queue, the
number of queue bytes that are in use to hold products, the maximum
number of products in the queue since it was created, and the age of
the oldest product in the queue.  </p> <p align="justify"> Here's an example of the
first two lines of output from invoking "pqmon -i 5", which prints a
line of queue statistics to standard output every 5 seconds:

<pre>
% pqmon -i 5
Nov 07 15:05:19 pqmon: Starting Up (7628)
Nov 07 15:05:19 pqmon: nprods nfree  nempty      nbytes  maxprods  maxfree  minempty    maxext  age
Nov 07 15:05:19 pqmon: 139246     3  336825  1949558728    173916      503    302150    441256 9663
Nov 07 15:05:24 pqmon: 139273     2  336799  1949992192    173916      503    302150     10312 9658
 ...
</pre>
<p align="justify">You will usually need a wide terminal to see all of the pqmon output on one 
  line. The statistics of primary use to LDM site administrators are the number 
  of products in the queue (<em>nprods</em>), the number of bytes of the product 
  queue currently in use (<em>nbytes</em>), the maximum number of products in 
  the queue so far (<em>maxprods</em>), and the age in seconds of the oldest product 
  in the queue (<em>age</em>). The above shows a product queue that contained 
  139246 products, about 1.95 Gbytes of data, a previous maximum of 173916 products, 
  and an age for the oldest product in the queue of 9663 seconds (about 2.68 hours). 
  5 seconds later, some of these statistics have changed as more products have 
  come in, more bytes have been added to the queue, and some old products have 
  been deleted. </p>
<p align="justify">
After you have run an LDM system for a while
and the queue has reached a steady state, where old products are being
expired to make room for new products as they arrive, it is useful to
note the age of the oldest product in the queue.  This is the last
column of <strong>pqmon</strong> output providing the age in seconds
of the oldest product.  If this is over 3600, you currently have
more than an
hour's worth of data in the queue.  If you are relaying data to
downstream sites, this would permit a downstream site to disconnect
and reconnect within an hour without losing data.
<p>
</p>
<p align="justify">As a rule of thumb, you want to make sure that your product queue is large 
  enough that the age of the oldest product does not go below 3600 seconds. Note 
  that you might want to watch the age of the oldest product for a while using 
  the <em>-i</em> option of <strong>pqmon</strong> to specify an interval in seconds 
  between outputs, because this number can vary over time. For example, if a large 
  product arrives and there is no free region in the queue big enough to hold 
  it, many old products might be deleted until enough room is available. </p>
<p align="justify">
Another useful statistic in
<strong>pqmon</strong> output is the maximum number of products stored
in the queue so far.  This is a "high-water mark" of the number of
products that could fit in the queue at once, and depends on the
distribution of product sizes over time.  For example, if a large
number of small products arrive in a short time interval replacing a
few large old products, the number of
products in the queue might rise.
</p>

<p align="justify">
It is desirable to allocate on creation more product slots in the queue than are
ever needed, so that products are only deleted for lack of space and not for
lack of empty product slots.  On the other hand, allocating too many product
slots that never get used wastes some space that could be used instead to hold
more products.  Each product slot only has an overhead of about 68 bytes,
however, so it is OK to over-allocate product slots to some extent to make sure
you don't run out.  By default, an average product size -- that is guaranteed to
be incorrect -- is used to compute the default number of product slots.
</p>

<p align="justify">
The other statistics in <strong>pqmon</strong> output are of less
relevance for tuning queue parameters, but may be useful to make sure
the allocation and garbage collection algorithms are working as
intended.
