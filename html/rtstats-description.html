    <h1>Overview of the <code>rtstats</code> program</h1>
    <p>In Unidata's LDM version 5.2, the new <code>rtstats</code> program has been introduced for real-time statistics
      reporting. This program is based on <code>pqbinstats</code> with the addition of <code>ldmsend</code> protocol to
      deliver statistics to an LDM server. <code>rtstats</code> scans an LDM product queue and creates products
      containing statistics for each feedtype being received. The products are assigned the EXP feedtype for delivery
      to the designated server specified using the<code>-h</code> option. </p>
    <p>An example exec line for ldmd.conf (included in src/server/ldmd.conf) which should be used to send statistics
      back to the UPC is: </p>
    <pre>
      exec    "rtstats -h rtstats.unidata.ucar.edu"
    </pre>
    <p>The statistics products are not placed in the local queue, and will not interfere with other site usage of the
      EXP feedtype. You should ensure that you are setting the time of your machine according to NTP (either using the
      ntp daemon or the ntpdate command frequently executed from cron) to ensure that the latency is being recorded
      accurately. The purpose of <code>rtstats</code> is to provide a more current depiction of the performance of the
      IDD (compared to those from <code>pqbinstats</code> which are generally mailed hourly), as well as topology
      information. <code>rtstats</code> will attempt to deliver statistics at least once every minute as long as data
      are arriving. </p>
    <p>If no host is specified using the -h option, <code>rtstats</code> will attempt to send the statistics to the LDM
      running on localhost. To store the statistics from the local LDM, the following pqact.conf FILE pattern/action can
      be used: </p>
    <pre>
      EXP     ^rtstats/(.*)/(.*)/(.*)
	    FILE	data/rtstats/\2/%Y%m%d/\1/\3
    </pre>
    <p>A separate statistic product will be sent for each FEEDTYPE and LDM product origin. For more information on the
      data included within the product or for other details, see the installed manual page on
      <code>rtstats(1)</code>.</p>
