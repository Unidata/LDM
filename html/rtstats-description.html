<h2>Overview of the <code>rtstats</code> program</h2>
<p> In Unidata's LDM version 5.2, the new <code>rtstats</code> program has been 
  introduced for real-time statistics reporting. This program is based on <code>pqbinstats</code> 
  with the addition of <code>ldmsend</code> protocol to deliver statistics to 
  an LDM server. <code>rtstats</code> scans an LDM product queue and creates products 
  containing statistics for each feedtype being received. The products are assigned 
  the EXP feedtype for delivery to the designated server specified using the<code> 
  -h</code> option. </p>
<p> An example exec line for ldmd.conf (included in src/server/ldmd.conf) which 
  should be used to send statistics back to the UPC is: 
<pre>
     exec    "rtstats -h rtstats.unidata.ucar.edu"
</pre>
<p></p>
<p> The statistics products are not placed in the local queue, and will not interfere 
  with other site usage of the EXP feedtype. You should ensure that you are setting 
  the time of your machine according to NTP (either using the ntp daemon or the 
  ntpdate command frequently executed from cron) to ensure that the latency is 
  being recorded accurately. The purpose of <code>rtstats</code> is to provide 
  a more current depiction of the performance of the IDD (compared to those from 
  <code>pqbinstats</code> which are generally mailed hourly), as well as topology 
  information. <code>rtstats</code> will attempt to deliver statistics at least 
  once every minute as long as data are arriving. </p>
<p> If no host is specified using the -h option, <code>rtstats</code> will attempt 
  to send the statistics to the LDM running on localhost. To store the statistics 
  from the local LDM, the following pqact.conf FILE pattern/action can be used: 
<pre>
EXP     ^rtstats/(.*)/(.*)/(.*)
	FILE	data/rtstats/\2/%Y%m%d/\1/\3
</pre>
<p></p>
<p> A separate statistic product will be sent for each FEEDTYPE and LDM product 
  origin. For more information on the data included within the product or for 
  other details, see the installed manual page on <code>rtstats(1)</code>.
