<h1 align="center">Running Multiple LDM-s</h1>       

<p>
It's possible to run multiple instances of an
<a href="glindex.html#LDM">LDM</a>
system on a single computer.  
This article explains how and leaves the "why" to the reader.

<p>
It is assumed that the reader is familiar with the installation and
configuration procedures for an 
<a href="glindex.html#LDM">LDM</a>
system.
For each
<a href="glindex.html#LDM">LDM</a>
system that you want to execute, build and install an 
<a href="glindex.html#LDM">LDM</a>
package
with the following modifications:

<ol>
    <li>Choose a distinct user-account with its own name (e.g., 
	<code>ldm2</code>) and home directory (e.g., <code>/local/ldm2</code>).

    <li>When executing the <tt>configure(1)</tt> script, use the option
	<code>--enable-logging=<a href="glindex.html#localn">local<i>n</i></a>
	</code>to set the logging facility.

    <li>Decide on one of the following approaches for allowing connections
	from downstream sites:

    <ul>

	<li>Decide on a distinct IP address to use.  This necessitates the use
	of a distinct network interface, which could be a real one (implemented
	in hardware) or a virtual one (implemented in software).  When 
        configuring the LDM installation, set the
        relevant "interface" parameter in the 
        <a href="glindex.html#LDM registry">LDM registry</a> to the IP
        address. Or

	<li>Select a distinct port on which the LDM server will listen. Use
	the <tt>--enable-port=port</tt> option of the <tt>configure(1)</tt>
        script to configure the LDM to use that port. On the downstream hosts,
        do one of the following:

	<ul>
            <li>Use the optional <tt>:<em>port</em></tt> field in REQUEST
            entries to specify to which port to connect.

	    <li>Configure the downstream LDM to use the same port via
	    the same <tt>--enable-port=<em>port</em></tt> option of the
	    <tt>configure(1)</tt> script.  This approach is recursive: further
	    downstream sites will also need to be modified.
	</ul>

    </ul>

</ol>
