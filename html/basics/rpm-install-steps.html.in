<h1 align="center">LDM RPM Installation</h1>       

<hr>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
First, let me acknowledge that I am not an RPM expert. Consequently, if you
have a suggestion on how to improve the RPM installation process, then please
send it to <a 
href="mailto:@PACKAGE_BUGREPORT@"><tt>@PACKAGE_BUGREPORT@</tt></a>.</p>

<p>Installing from an RPM is, necessarily, less flexible than installing from
source. In particular, the following constraints apply:
<ul>
    <li>Not all platforms are supported. Supported ones are encoded within
    the name of the RPM file. </li>
    
    <li>If the <a href="glindex.html#LDM user">LDM user</a> doesn't exist, then
    they will be created with the name "ldm", with default user and group
    ID-s, and with the value of <tt>rpm(1)</tt>'s <tt>prefix</tt> option as
    their home-directory. </li>
    
    <li>All utilities will be dynamically linked and only the sharable LDM
    library will be installed.
    
    <li>The top-level <a href="glindex.html#LDM">LDM</a> server,
    <a href="glindex.html#ldmd"><tt>ldmd</tt></a>, will listen on port 388.</li>
    
    <li>The "<a href="glindex.html#localn">local0</a>" logging facility will be
    used.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Installations Steps</h2>

<ol>

<li>Become the superuser (<i>i.e.</i>, "root").</li>

<li>Download the appropriate RPM from
<a href="ftp://ftp.unidata.ucar.edu/pub/ldm/"><tt>
ftp://ftp.unidata.ucar.edu/pub/ldm/</tt></a>.</li>

<li>Install the package with the command
<blockquote><pre>
rpm --install [--prefix=<em>ldmhome</em>] <em>rpm-file</em>
</pre></blockquote>
where <em>rpm-file</em> is the RPM file that you just downloaded.
The square brackets denote an optional argument in which <em>ldmhome</em> is the
home-directory of the <a href="glindex.html#LDM user">LDM user</a>. The default
home-directory is <tt>/opt/ldm</tt>.
This option must be used if
<ol>
    <li>An LDM user account exists on the platform with a home-directory that
    differs from the default; or</li>
    <li>An LDM user account doesn't exist on the platform and you want the
    LDM user to have a home-directory that differs from the default.
</ol>
</li>
