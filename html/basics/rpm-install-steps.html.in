    <h1>LDM RPM Installation</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>First, let me acknowledge that I am not an RPM expert. Consequently, if you have a suggestion on how to improve
    the RPM installation process, then please send it to
    <a href="mailto:@PACKAGE_BUGREPORT@">@PACKAGE_BUGREPORT@</a>.</p>
    <p>Installing from an RPM is, necessarily, less flexible than installing from source. In particular, the following
    constraints apply:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Not all platforms are supported. Supported ones are encoded within the name of the RPM file. </li>
      <li>If the <a href="glindex.html#LDM user">LDM user</a> doesn't exist, then they will be created with the name
      "ldm", with default user and group ID-s, and with the value of rpm(1)'s prefix option as their
      home-directory. </li>
      <li>All utilities will be dynamically linked and only the sharable LDM library will be installed.</li>
      <li>The top-level <a href="glindex.html#LDM">LDM</a> server, <a href="glindex.html#ldmd">ldmd</a>, will listen on
      port 388.</li>
      <li>The "<a href="glindex.html#localn">local0</a>" logging facility will be used.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Installations Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Become the superuser (<i>i.e.</i>, "root").</li>
      <li>Download the appropriate RPM from
        <a href="https://downloads.unidata.ucar.edu/ldm/">https://downloads.unidata.ucar.edu/ldm/</a>.</li>
      <li>Install the package with the command <code>rpm --install [--prefix=<i>ldmhome</i>] <i>rpm-file</i></code>
      where <i>rpm-file</i> is the RPM file that you just downloaded. The square brackets denote an optional argument
      in which <i>ldmhome</i> is the home-directory of the <a href="glindex.html#LDM user">LDM user</a>. The default
      home-directory is /home/ldm. This option must be used if</li>
      <ol>
        <li>An LDM user account exists on the platform with a home-directory that  differs from the default; or</li>
        <li>An LDM user account doesn't exist on the platform and you want the LDM user to have a home-directory that
        differs from the default.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
