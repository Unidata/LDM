<h2><a name="can't start LDM">Can't start the LDM</h2>

If the LDM won't start, then it should log the reason why. Check the LDM
log file.
<p>
If that is inconclusive, then start the LDM in interactive mode by explicitly
telling it to log to the standard error stream via the <code>-l</code> option.
Execute the command
<blockquote><code>
<pre>ldmd -l- [-v]</pre>
</code></blockquote>
This will prevent the LDM from daemonizing itself and it will log directly to
the terminal. The running LDM can be stopped by typing <code>^C</code> (control-C).

<hr>

<h2><a name="config-file">The LDM server terminates after executing its
configuration-file</h2>

This could be caused by
<ul>
    <li>An effectively empty configuration-file
    <li>A commented-out <code>ALLOW</code> entry for <code>localhost</code> and
        <code>127.0.0.1</code>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2><a name="LDM not logging">The LDM isn't logging</h2>
<ol>
    <li>
    Verify that logging doesn't occur with the commands
    <blockquote><code>
<pre>ulogger This is a test 2>/dev/null
tail -1 ~/var/logs/ldmd.log</pre>
    </code></blockquote>
    If the above prints "<samp>This is a test</samp>", then LDM logging works.
    <p>
    <li>
    Verify that the LDM log file is owned and writable by the LDM user:
    <blockquote><code>
<pre>ls -l ~/var/logs/ldmd.log</pre>
    </code></blockquote>
    If it's not, then make it so: 
    <blockquote><code>
<pre>sudo chown ldm ~/var/logs/ldmd.log
chmod u+w ~/var/logs/ldmd.log</pre>
    </code></blockquote>
    <li>
    Verify that the disk partition that contains the LDM log file isn't full:
        <blockquote><code>
<pre>df ~/var/logs/ldmd.log</pre>
        </code></blockquote>
        If it's full, then purge stuff.
    <p>
    <li>
    If the script "<code>~/bin/refresh_logging</code>" doesn't exist or simply
    executes the utility <code>hupsyslog(1)</code>, then
    <ul>
        <li>
        Verify that the system logging daemon is running via the command
        <blockquote><code>
<pre>ps -ef | grep syslog</pre>
        </code></blockquote>
        If it's not running, then start it.
        <p>
        <li>
        Determine the veracity of the following:
        <ul>
            <li>
            The configuration-file for the system logging daemon has an entry
            for the LDM:
            <blockquote><code>
<pre>grep local /etc/*syslog.conf | grep ldm</pre>
            </code></blockquote>
            <li>
            The utility <code>hupsyslog(1)</code> is owned by root and setuid:
            <blockquote><code>
<pre>ls -l ~/bin/hupsyslog</pre>
            </code></blockquote>
        </ul>
        If any of the above are false, then execute the command &mdash; as root
        &mdash; "<code>make root-actions</code>" in the top-level LDM
        source-directory.
        <p>
        <li>
        Restart the system logging daemon and then retry the
        <code>ulogger</code> command above.
        <p>
        <li>
        If on a system that has SELINUX, verify that it is disabled or in
        permissive mode:
        <blockquote><code>
<pre>getenforce</pre>
        </code></blockquote>
        To change from enabled mode to permissive mode, execute &mdash; as root
        &mdash; the command
        <blockquote><code>
<pre>setenforce permissive</pre>
        </code></blockquote>
        To disable SELINUX, edit the file <code>/etc/selinux/config</code> and set
        the variable <code>SELINUX</code> to <code>disabled</code>. Then, reboot the
        system.
        <p>
        <li>
        Verify that the disk partition containing the <code>~/bin</code> directory
        does <em>not</em> have the <code>nosuid</code> attribute:
        <blockquote><code>
<pre>dev=`df ~/bin | tail -1 | awk '{print $1}'`
mount | grep $dev | grep nosuid</pre>
        </code></blockquote>
        If the <code>nosuid</code> attribute is enabled, then <code>hupsyslog</code>
        will not work. Either that attribute must be disabled or the LDM package
        must be re-installed on a disk partition that has that attribute
        disabled.
    </ul>
</ol>

<h2><a name="not_receiving">The LDM isn't receiving data</h2>

<ol>
<li>Are you sure? Verify that the LDM hasn't received the data-products in
question by executing &mdash; as the LDM user &mdash; this command on the same
system as the LDM:
    <blockquote><code>
<pre>notifyme -v [-f <em>feedtype</em>] [-p <em>pattern</em>] -o 9999999</pre>
    </code></blockquote>
    where <em><code>feedtype</code></em> and <em><code>pattern</code></em> are a feed
    specification and extended regular expression, respectively, that match the
    missing data-products.
    <p>
    If this command indicates that the LDM is unavailable, then start it;
    otherwise, continue.
<p>
<li>Verify that your system clock is correct. If your LDM asks for data-products
from the future, then it won't receive anything until that time.
<p>
<li>Verify that each upstream LDM that should be sending the data-products is,
indeed, receiving those data-products by executing &mdash; as
the LDM user &mdash; this command on the downstream system:
    <blockquote><code>
<pre>notifyme -v [-f <em>feedtype</em>] [-p <em>pattern</em>] -o 9999999 -h <i>host</i></pre>
    </code></blockquote>
    where <em><code>feedtype</code></em> and <em><code>pattern</code></em> are as
    before and <i>host</i> is the hostname of the upstream LDM system (you can
    get this from the relevant <code>REQUEST</code> entries in the LDM
    configuration-file).
    <p>
    If the <code>notifyme(1)</code> command indicates that
        <ul>
        <li><b>The upstream LDM isn't running</b> (i.e.,
        the connection is refused), then it must be started.
        <p>
        <li>
        <b>The upstream LDM is unreachable</b>, then you 
        have a networking issue. This can be verified by executing the following
        command on the downstream host:
        <blockquote><code>
<pre>telnet <i>host</i> 388</pre>
        </code></blockquote>
        Contact your network administrator and show them the <code>telnet(1)</code>
        command.
        <p>
        <li>
        <b>The upstream LDM won't honor the request</b>, then the upstream LDM
        doesn't have a relevant
        <code>ALLOW</code> entry for the downstream LDM in its
        configuration-file. This could be because the upstream LDM allows the
        downstream LDM <em>by name</em> but that name 
        can't be determined by the upstream LDM by performing a
        reverse-DNS lookup on the downstream host's IP address. A reverse-DNS
        lookup can be verified via the command
        <blockquote><code>
<pre>dig -x <i>IP_address</i></pre>
        </code></blockquote>
        or
        <blockquote><code>
<pre>nslookup <i>IP_address</i></pre>
        </code></blockquote>
        where <i>IP_address</i> is the IP address of the downstream LDM's host.
        If the reverse-DNS lookup fails and the upstream LDM allows by
        name, then you should contact your network administrator and show them
        the result of the above command. If the reverse-DNS lookup succeeds,
        then the upstream LDM likely doesn't have an <code>ALLOW</code> entry
        for the downstream LDM and you should contact the upstream LDM user.
        <p>
        <li>
        <b>The upstream LDM is, indeed, receiving the data-products</b>, then
        either
            <ul>
            <li>There's something wrong with the associated <code>REQUEST</code>
            entry in the downstream LDM's configuration-file (Does it exist? Is
            it correct?); or
            <p>
            <li>The upstream site is using the <i>NOT</i> field of the relevant
            <code>ALLOW</code> entry in the upstream LDM's configuration-file to
            prevent the downstream LDM from receiving the data-products. You'll
            need to contact the upstream LDM user.
            </ul>
        <p>
        <li>
        <b>The upstream LDM is <em>not</em> receiving the data-products</b>,
        then either change your <code>REQUEST</code> entry to a host whose LDM
        <em>is</em> receiving the data-products or execute this section on the
        upstream system.
        </ul>
</ol>

<h2><a name="LDM suddenly disappears">The LDM suddenly disappears on an
RHEL/CentOS system</h2>

Several LDM users have reported the sudden disappearance of a running LDM on
their RHEL/CentOS 6 or 7 systems. There's no warning: nothing in the LDM log
file. It just vanishes &mdash; as if the superuser had sent it a
<code>SIGKILL</code> with extreme prejudice.
<p>
It turns out, that's exactly what happened. Only, it wasn't the superuser
<i>per se</i>, but the out-of-memory manager acting on behalf of the superuser.
The smoking gun is an entry in the system log file from the out-of-memory
manager about terminating the LDM process around the time that it disappears.
<p>
The current workaround is to tell the out-of-memory (OOM) manager that the LDM
processes are important by assigning the LDM process-group a particular "score".
LDM user Daryl Herzmann explains:
<blockquote>
So there is a means to set a "score" on each Linux process to inform the oom
killer about how it should prioritizing the killing.  For RHEL/centos 6+7, this
can be done by `echo -1000 > /proc/$PID/oom_score_adj`.  For some other Linux
flavours, the score should be -17 and the proc file is oom_adj.  Google is your
friend!
<p>
A simple <code>crontab(1)</code> entry like so will set this value for ldmd
automatically each hour.
<blockquote><code>
<pre>1 * * * * root pgrep -f "ldmd" | while read PID; do echo -1000 > /proc/$PID/oom_score_adj; done</pre>
</code></blockquote>
Of course, this solution would have a small window of time between a ldm restart
and the top of the next hour whereby the score would not be set. There are
likely more robust solutions here I am blissfully ignorant of.
</blockquote>
<p>
The OOM killer can be completely disabled with the following command. This is
not recommended for production environments, because if an out-of-memory
condition does present itself, there could be unexpected behavior depending on
the available system resources and configuration. This unexpected behavior could
be anything from a kernel panic to a hang depending on the resources available
to the kernel at the time of the OOM condition.
<blockquote><code>
<pre>sysctl vm.overcommit_memory=2
echo "vm.overcommit_memory=2" >> /etc/sysctl.conf</pre>
</code></blockquote>

<h2><a name="ldmadmin scour takes too long on an XFS file-system">
"<code>ldmadmin scour</code>" takes too long</h2>
Daryl Herzmann encountered this problem on his system, which uses the XFS
filesystem. As he explained it
<blockquote>
Please, I don't wish to start a war regarding which filesystem is the best
here...  If you have used XFS (now default filesystem in RHEL7) in the past, you
may have suffered from very poor performance with IO related to small files. 
For me and LDM, this would rear its very ugly head when I wished to `ldmadmin
scour` the /data/ folder.  It would take 4+ hours to scour out a days worth of
NEXRAD III files.  If you looked at output like sysstat, you would see the
process at 100% iowait.

I created a thread about this on the redhat community forums[1] and was kindly
responded to by one of the XFS developers, Eric Sandeen.  He wrote the
following:
<blockquote>
    This is because your xfs filesystem does not store the filetype in the
    directory, and so every inode in the tree must be stat'd (read) to
    determine the filetype when you use the "-type f" qualifier. This is
    much slower than just reading directory information. In RHEL7.3,
    mkfs.xfs will enable filetypes by default. You can do so today with
    "mkfs.xfs -n ftype=1".
</blockquote>

So what he is saying is that you have to reformat your filesystem to take
advantage of this setting.

So I did some testing and now `ldmadmin scour` takes only 4 minutes to
transverse the NEXRAD III directory tree!
