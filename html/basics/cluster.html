    <h1>LDM Clusters</h1>

    <p>An <a href="glindex.html#LDM">LDM</a> cluster is a configuration of multiple computers running multiple
      <a href="glindex.html#LDM">LDM</a>-s that appear to be a single computer on which a single
      <a href="glindex.html#LDM">LDM</a> is running.  Because multiple computers are involved, the effective performance
      of the cluster (i.e., the number of connections that can be satisfied) can be much greater than that of a single
      computer (providing that network bandwidth is not a limiting factor).  The reliability of a cluster can also be
      greater than that of a single computer.</p>
    <p>The structure and operation of an <a href="glindex.html#LDM">LDM</a> cluster depends upon the operating systems
      involved as well as the software package that's used to cluster the computers.  Therefore, this webpage will only
      explain the experimental <a href="glindex.html#LDM">LDM</a> cluster in-use at the
      <a href="glindex.html#UPC">UPC</a>. Hopefully, this description will help you regarding your own cluster.</p>
    <p>The architecture of the cluster involves a "director" computer and multiple "backend" computers.  The director
      computer runs Linux and the IP Virtual Server (IPVS) software. Each backend computer runs a default
      <a href="glindex.html#LDM">LDM</a> installation on an arbitrary operating-system and doesn't know that it's part
      of a cluster.</p>
    <p>There is a single IP address by which the cluster is known to external hosts.  This is the "cluster IP address".
      All IP packets destined for the cluster IP address go to the director computer.</p>
    <p>The IPVS software on the director computer is responsible for forwarding incoming packets received on the
      <a href="glindex.html#LDM">LDM</a> port to the backend computers. If a
      <a href="glindex.html#downstream host">downstream host</a> has an open <a href="glindex.html#TCP">TCP</a>
      connection to the cluster IP address or has had one within the last minute, then the software forwards all
      incoming <a href="glindex.html#TCP">TCP</a> packets from that host to the same backend computer. Otherwise, an
      incoming <a href="glindex.html#TCP">TCP</a> packet is forwarded to the least-loaded backend computer.</p>
    <p>The IPVS software on the director computer maintains a pool of backend computers by monitoring their
      availability. Should one go offline, then it is removed from the pool and packets will no longer be forwarded to
      it. This allows for easy maintenance of the backend computers. Conversely, should a new backend computer go
      online, then it is added to the pool of available backend computers.</p>
    <p>Each backend computer has two IP addresses corresponding to two network interfaces.  One of the IP addresses is
      specific that that computer; the other IP address is the cluster IP address.  The backend computer's cluster IP
      address is not broadcast via the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) so it is not known by any routers. The LDM on
      each backend computer is told to use the computer-specific IP address for requesting data. The network interfaces
      are either real (implemented in hardware) or virtual (implemented in software). </p>
    <p>The <a href="glindex.html#LDM">LDM</a> systems on the backend computers each have their own product-queue and are
      individually responsible for requesting and receiving <a href="glindex.html#data-product">data-product</a>s.</p>
