    <h1>The LDM Product-Queue</h1>
    <p><img src="product-queue.svg" alt="LDM Product-Queue"></p>
    <p>The product-queue is a memory-mapped file that temporarily stores
			<a href="glindex.html#data-product">data-product</a>s. Access to the product-queue is via the pq module, which
			coordinates access by the reading and writing processes to ensure that the product-queue isn't corrupted.</p>
    <p>The product-queue has the following characteristics:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The number of <a href="glindex.html#data-product">data-product</a>s that the queue can contain is fixed when
				the queue is created. This is the number of <a href="glindex.html#data-product">data-product</a>
				<i>slots</i>.</li>
      <li>The amount of data that the queue can contain is fixed when the queue is created. This is the <i>size of the
				queue</i>.</li>
      <li>A <a href="glindex.html#data-product">data-product</a> is inserted into the product-queue in contiguous space
				and indexed by the time of insertion according to the system clock.</li>
      <li>A <a href="glindex.html#data-product">data-product</a> will <i>not</i> be inserted into the product-queue if
				its <a href="glindex.html#signature">signature</a> (i.e., MD5 checksum) equals that of a product already in the
				queue.</li>
      <li>Reading a <a href="glindex.html#data-product">data-product</a> from the queue creates a read-lock on that
				product.  Read-locks can be shared by reading processes.</li>
      <li><a href="glindex.html#data-product">Data-product</a>s  read from the product-queue sequentially are returned
				in time-sorted order (oldest first) according to the insertion-time.  Therefore,
				<a href="glindex.html#data-product">data-product</a>s can be skipped if the system clock is set backwards.</li>
      <li>Writing a <a href="glindex.html#data-product">data-product</a> into the queue creates a write-lock on that
				product.  Write-locks can't be shared.</li>
      <li>If a new <a href="glindex.html#data-product">data-product</a> can't be added, either because no space is
				available for the <a href="glindex.html#data-product">data-product</a> or because no slot is available, then
				unlocked <a href="glindex.html#data-product">data-product</a>s are deleted from the queue -- beginning with the
				oldest <a href="glindex.html#data-product">data-product</a> and continuing to the youngest -- until addition is
				possible.</li>
      <li id="writer-counter">A <i>writer-counter</i> field in the product-queue keeps track of the number of times the
				product-queue has been opened for writing.  Opening the product-queue for writing increments the counter;
				closing the product-queue decrements the counter.  If no process has the product-queue open for writing, then
				the <i>writer-counter</i> should be 0.  This counter is used to ensure that the product-queue has been properly
				closed by all processes that could modify it.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The canonical pathname of the LDM product-queue, relative to the LDM home-directory, is var/data/ldm.pq</p>
