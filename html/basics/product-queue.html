<h1 align="center">The LDM Product-Queue</h1>

<p>The product-queue is a memory-mapped file that temporarily
stores <a href="glindex.html#data-product">data-product</a>s.
Access to the product-queue is via the <tt>pq</tt> module, which
coordinates access by the reading and writing processes 
to ensure that the product-queue isn't corrupted.

<p>The product-queue has the following characteristics:
<ul>
    <li>The number of <a
	href="glindex.html#data-product">data-product</a>s 
	that the queue can contain is fixed when the queue is created.
	This is the number of
	<a href="glindex.html#data-product">data-product</a> <em>slots</em>.
    <li>The amount of data 
	that the queue can contain is fixed when the queue is created.
	This is the <em>size of the queue</em>.
    <li>A <a href="glindex.html#data-product">data-product</a> is
	inserted into the product-queue in contiguous space and indexed 
	by the time of insertion according to the system clock.
    <li>A <a href="glindex.html#data-product">data-product</a> will <em>not</em>
	be inserted into the product-queue if its
	<a href="glindex.html#signature">signature</a> (i.e., MD5 checksum) 
	equals that of a product already in the queue.
    <li>Reading a <a href="glindex.html#data-product">data-product</a>
	from the queue creates a read-lock on that product.
	Read-locks can be shared by reading processes.
    <li><a href="glindex.html#data-product">Data-product</a>s
	read from the product-queue sequentially are returned in time-sorted
	order (oldest first) according to the insertion-time.  Therefore,
	<a href="glindex.html#data-product">data-product</a>s
	can be skipped if the system clock is set backwards.
    <li>Writing a <a href="glindex.html#data-product">data-product</a>
	into the queue creates a write-lock on that product.
	Write-locks can't be shared.
    <li>If a new <a
	href="glindex.html#data-product">data-product</a> 
	can't be added,
	either because no space is available for the 
	<a href="glindex.html#data-product">data-product</a> 
	or because no slot is available, then
	unlocked <a href="glindex.html#data-product">data-product</a>s
	are deleted from the queue -- begining with the oldest <a
	href="glindex.html#data-product">data-product</a> and
	continuing to the youngest -- until addition is possible.
    <li>A <a name="writer-counter"><i>writer-counter</i></a>
	field in the product-queue keeps track 
	of the number of times
	the product-queue has been opened for writing.  Opening the 
	product-queue for writing increments the counter; closing the
	product-queue decrements the counter.  If no process has the 
	product-queue open for writing, then the <i>writer-counter</i>
	should be 0.  This counter is used to ensure that the product-queue
	has been properly closed by all processes that could modify it.
</ul>

<p>
The canonical pathname of the LDM product-queue, relative to the LDM
home-directory, is <tt>var/data/ldm.pq</tt>
