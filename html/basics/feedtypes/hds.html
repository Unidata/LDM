    <h1>High resolution Data Service (HDS)</h1>
    <p>One of the NWS Family of Services (FOS) data streams, HDS is primarily comprised of binary products containing
      centrally generated analysis and forecast fields in binary formats such as GRIB.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Currently from the IDD, this stream contains more than just the  HDS products, because it is generated from
        the binary NOAAPORT NWSTG products.  Thus it also includes profiler data in WMO BUFR format, and other binary
        products.</li>
    </ul>
