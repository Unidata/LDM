  Experiment <a href="http://usgodae3.fnmoc.navy.mil/"> <b>(GODAE)</b></a> 
  server. This feedtype also has the alias "NOGAPS". Additionally, the newly introduced 
  alias "FNMOC", is available in LDM version 5.1.4 or greater. This latter alias 
  was introduced as we became aware that FNMOC would be providing more than one

<!--
Although both product IDs start with
US058, the NOGAPS data uses model ID 0058, while the COAMPS models are
0027, 0041, 0060, 0083, and 0082.  Note that the second pattern simply
files any non-0058 model as COAMPS data.
