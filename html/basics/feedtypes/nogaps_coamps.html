    <h1>FNMOC/NOGAPS/FT19 Feedtype</h1>
    <p>Feedtype FT19 is currently allocated to FNMOC's Global Ocean Data Assimilation Experiment (GODAE) server. This
      feedtype also has the alias "NOGAPS". Additionally, the newly introduced  alias "FNMOC", is available in LDM
      version 5.1.4 or greater. This latter alias was introduced as we became aware that FNMOC would be providing more
      than one data stream. </p>
    <p>FNMOC currently provides two data streams via Unidata's Internet Data Distribution (IDD) network under the FNMOC
      feedtype: the Navy Operational Global Atmospheric Prediction System
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navy_Operational_Global_Atmospheric_Prediction_System"><b>(NOGAPS)</b></a> stream and
      the Coupled Ocean Atmosphere Mesoscale Prediction System
      <a href="https://www.nrlmry.navy.mil/coamps-web/web/view"><b>(COAMPS)</b></a>
      stream.</p>

  <p>Although both product IDs start with US058, the NOGAPS data uses model ID 0058, while the COAMPS models are 0027,
  0041, 0060, 0083, and 0082.  Note that the second pattern simply files any non-0058 model as COAMPS data.</p>
