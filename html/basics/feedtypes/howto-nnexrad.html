    <h1>How to Get NOAAPORT NEXRAD Data via the LDM</h1>

    <p>Detailed information about the NOAAPORT NEXRAD feed is available from the Unidata
      <a href="https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/data/radar.html"><b>NOAAPORT NEXRAD Feed page</b></a>, including
      alternatives to using the LDM to get the data. Most sites will only want to get a subset of the NOAAPORT NEXRAD
      data via the LDM, because of the large number of products and volume of the data. This document describes how to
      get selected subsets of the new data stream.</p>
    <p>First, determine who your upstream site is for the Family Of Services (FOS) data. There should already be a line 
      in your etc/ldmd.conf configuration file requesting data from your upstream FOS site, which we will call 
      <i>your.floater.feed</i> for the rest of this document. This is the host from which you should get the NEXRAD
      Floater Feed.</p>
    <p>Next, determine who your upstream site is for the NEXRAD feed, by looking at the 
      <a href="https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/projects/idd/nexradFeed.html"><b>NEXRAD Feed Scheme</b></a>, locating your 
      host, and determining the first tier site <i>in italics</i> above your site name. We'll call this 
      <i>your.nexrad.feed</i> in the remainder of this document. This is the assignment for the host from which you 
      will get NEXRAD data other than the NEXRAD Floater Feed, if desired.  <i>your.floater.feed</i> and 
      <i>your.nexrad.feed</i> may or may not be identical.</p>
    <p>The NEXRAD floater feed is named "FNEXRAD" ("NMC3" for LDM version 5.1.2 and earlier). It is not necessary to
      upgrade to a later version of the LDM just to be able to use the new FNEXRAD feed type name. In the rest of this
      document, we will use the "NMC3" feedtype, since a number of sites are still using LDM version 5.1.2 or earlier.
      "NMC3" will also work for later versions, but if you have LDM 5.1.3 or later, we suggest that you use "FNEXRAD"
      instead.</p>
    <p>Before trying to get the NEXRAD floater data or a subset of the full NEXRAD data feed, you can check that the
      data is available to you from upstream sites by using the "notifyme" command. To avoid having to wait for new
      products, you can quickly check data for the previous hour with (<code>-o 3600</code>). For example, for the
      NEXRAD floater, use:</p>
    <pre>
      notifyme -v -l- -h <i>your.floater.feed</i> -f NMC3 -o 3600
    </pre>
    <p>where <i>your.floater.feed</i> refers to the upstream source for Family Of Services (FOS) data such as IDS,
      DDPLUS, and HDS. Similarly, to check availability for the full NEXRAD feed, use:</p>
    <pre>
      notifyme -v -l- -h <i>your.nexrad.feed</i> -f NEXRAD -o 3600
    </pre>

    <h2>To specify what to do with the NEXRAD data</h2>
    <p>Before you start getting the data, decide what you want to do with it by adding lines to your pqact.conf
      configuration file for decoding or filing the data.</p>

    <h3>NEXRAD Feed</h3>
    <p>You will need to know something about the parts of the product ID for NOAAPORT NEXRAD products if you want to be
      able to specify actions that depend on information in the product ID.  In general, the product ID includes a WMO
      header followed by a six-character AFOS PILS code following "<code>/p</code>":</p>
    <pre>

    <table>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <th>i</th>
          <td>digit identifying the type of data (The first digit is either 2, 3, 5, or 7.)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>j</th>

    </table>
    <ol>
      <li>Add appropriate NEXRAD entries to your pqact.conf file. Remember to use tabs characters to separate the
        feedtype, pattern, and action fields. For example, if you wanted to file recent compressed floater data in a
        "data/nexrad/" directory using the time, station, and product identifier in the file name, you might add an
        entry something like this to pqact.conf:</li>
	    <pre>
        NMC3 SDUS[2357]. .... (......) /p(...)(...)
        FILE -close -overwrite data/nexrad/\1\3\2.raw
      </pre>
      <li>Check your pqact.conf configuration file to make sure there are no syntax errors:</li>
	    <pre>
        ldmadmin pqactcheck
      </pre>
      <li>Send pqact a signal to reread pqact.conf so it can process new NEXRAD data: </li>
	    <pre>
        ldmadmin pqactHUP
      </pre>
    </ol>

    <h3>FNEXRAD Feed</h3>
    <p>To get <b>all</b> of the Unidata NEXRAD floater feed containing data for several NEXRAD sites where "interesting"
      weather is occurring and composite imagery created by the UPC from select NEXRAD Level III products from all
      reporting stations:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Edit your ldmd.conf configuration file to contain the line. (<b>Caution:</b>The NEXRAD composite imagery can
        consume quite a bit of disk space after decoding.  For example, the 1 km National Base Reflectivity Composite
        gets uncompressed to a 14 MB file.  Since his product is transmitted every 6-10 minutes, you can consume a lot
        of disk space in a short amount of time!)</li>
      <pre>
        request NMC3 ".*" your.floater.feed
      </pre>
      <li>Stop your ldm:</li>
      <pre>
        ldmadmin stop
      </pre>
      <li>Make sure you wait until all the ldm processes have died before restarting:</li>
      <pre>
        ldmadmin start
      </pre>
    </ol>
    <p>To get a subset of the NEXRAD Level III products for the floater sites, for example only the base reflectivity
      and velocity products for the lowest tilt (N0R and N0V products), replace the pattern for all products ".*" in the
      above with a pattern for the specific products you want:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Edit your ldmd.conf configuration file to contain the line. (3-character AFOS PIL codes for NEXRAD products
        are available from the
        <a href="https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/data/radar.html"><b>NOAAPORT NEXRAD Feed page</b></a>.</li>
      <pre>
        request NMC3 "/p(N0R|N0V)" <i>your.floater.feed</i>
      </pre>
      <li>Stop your ldm with</li>
      <pre>
        ldmadmin stop
      </pre>
      <li>Wait until all the ldm processes have died before restarting, with</li>
      <pre>
        ldmadmin start
      </pre>
    </ol>
    <p>To get only the composite images in PNG-compressed format, replace the pattern for all products ".*" in the above
      with a pattern for the specific products:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Edit your ldmd.conf configuration file to contain the line</li>
      <pre>
        request NMC3 "^(pnga2area|rad)" your.floater.feed
      </pre>
      <li>Stop your ldm with
      <pre>
        ldmadmin stop
      </pre>
      <li>Wait until all the ldm processes have died before restarting, with</li>
      <pre>
        ldmadmin start
      </pre>
    </ol>
    <p>To help you refine your ldmd.conf requests for FNEXRAD data, we provide the following examples of IDD headers for
      the PNG-compressed composite images (current as of May 17, 2002):</p>

    <h2>To get the NEXRAD products for a few selected sites</h2>
    <p>To specify a few select sites for which NEXRAD data is always desired, first get the 3-character site codes for
      the sites from <a href="https://www.wunderground.com/maps/radar/current"><b>NEXRAD Site Map</b></a>. For the examples,
      let's assume you choose to get  data from sites designated "ABC" and "XYZ":</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Edit your ldmd.conf configuration file to contain the following line (after any other request lines, using
        tabs to delimit the fields.)</li>
      <pre>
        request NNEXRAD "/p...(ABC|XYZ)" your.nexrad.feed
      </pre>
      <li>Stop your ldm with</li>
      <pre>
        ldmadmin stop
      </pre>
      <li>Make sure you wait until all the ldm processes have died before restarting, with</li>
      <pre>
        ldmadmin start
      </pre>
    </ol>
    <p>Note that if you want to change the site selection, it is necessary to repeat all three of the above steps: there
      is no way to get the LDM to reread the ldmd.conf file without stopping and restarting it.</p>
    <p>To get just a subset of products, say base reflectivity and base radial velocity for the lowest tilt (N0R and N0V
      products), replace the product pattern "..." in the above with a pattern for the specific products you want:</p>
    <pre>
      request NNEXRAD "/p(N0R|N0V)(ABC|XYZ)" your.nexrad.feed
    </pre>
    <p>which specifies 2 products from each of 2 sites.</p>
    <p>To specify NEXRAD products from one of <b>10 U.S. regions</b>, you can specify a pattern that matches NEXRAD
      products from only the desired region. For example, "SDUS[2357]4" designates products from the South Central
      U.S. (TX, AL, MS, LA, AR, TN, OK):</p>
    <pre>
      request NNEXRAD "^SDUS[2357]4" your.nexrad.feed
    </pre>
    <p>If you only wanted base reflectivity and base radial velocity for the lowest tilt (N0R and N0V products) for
      radars in this region, use:</p>
    <pre>
      request NNEXRAD "^SDUS[2357]4 .* /p(N0R|N0V)" your.nexrad.feed
    </pre>
