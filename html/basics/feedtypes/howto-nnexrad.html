<h2 align="center">How to Get NOAAPORT NEXRAD Data via the LDM</h2>
<br>

<p align="justify"> Detailed information about the NOAAPORT NEXRAD feed is available 
  from the Unidata <a href="/data/radar.html"><b>NOAAPORT NEXRAD Feed page</b></a>, including 
  alternatives to using the LDM to get the data. Most sites will only want to 
  get a subset of the NOAAPORT NEXRAD data via the LDM, because of the large number 
  of products and volume of the data. This document describes how to get selected 
  subsets of the new data stream.</p>

<p align="justify">First, determine who your upstream site is for the Family Of
Services (FOS) data. There should already be a line in your etc/ldmd.conf
configuration file requesting data from your upstream FOS site,
which we will call <em>your.floater.feed</em> for the rest of this
document. This is the host from which you should get the NEXRAD
Floater Feed.</p>

<p align="justify">Next, determine who your upstream site is for the NEXRAD feed, 
  by looking at the <a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/projects/idd/nexradFeed.html"><b>NEXRAD 
  Feed Scheme</b></a>, locating your host, and determining the first tier site 
  <em>in italics</em> above your site name. We'll call this <em>your.nexrad.feed</em> 
  in the remainder of this document. This is the assignment for the host from 
  which you will get NEXRAD data other than the NEXRAD Floater Feed, if desired. 
  <em>your.floater.feed</em> and <em>your.nexrad.feed</em> may or may not be identical.</p>

<p align="justify">The NEXRAD floater feed is named "FNEXRAD" ("NMC3" for LDM version
5.1.2 and earlier). It is not necessary to upgrade to a later version
of the LDM just to be able to use the new FNEXRAD feed type name. In
the rest of this document, we will use the "NMC3" feedtype, since a number of
sites are still using LDM version 5.1.2 or earlier. "NMC3" will also work
for later versions, but if you have LDM 5.1.3 or later, we suggest that you
use "FNEXRAD" instead.</p>

<p align="justify">Before trying to get the NEXRAD floater data or a subset of the
full NEXRAD data feed, you can check that the data is available to
you from upstream sites by using the "notifyme" command. To avoid
having to wait for new products, you can quickly check data for the
previous hour with (<code>-o 3600</code>). For example, for the
NEXRAD floater, use:</p>

<pre>notifyme -v -l- -h <em>your.floater.feed</em> -f NMC3 -o 3600
</pre>

<p align="justify">
where <em>your.floater.feed</em> refers to the upstream source for
Family Of Services (FOS) data such as IDS, DDPLUS, and HDS.
Similarly, to check availability for the full NEXRAD feed, use:</p>

<pre>notifyme -v -l- -h <em>your.nexrad.feed</em> -f NEXRAD -o 3600
</pre>

<br>
 

<h2>To specify what to do with the NEXRAD data</h2>

<p align="justify">Before you start getting the data, decide what you want to do
with it by adding lines to your pqact.conf configuration file for
decoding or filing the data.</p>

<p>
</p><h3>NEXRAD Feed</h3>

<p align="justify">
You will need to know something about the parts of the product ID for
NOAAPORT NEXRAD products if you want to be able to specify actions
that depend on information in the product ID.  In general, the product
ID includes a WMO header followed by a six-character AFOS PILS code
following "<code>/p</code>":

<ol>
  <li> 
	<p align="justify"> Add appropriate NEXRAD entries to your pqact.conf file. 
	  Remember to use tabs characters to separate the feedtype, pattern, and action 
	  fields. For example, if you wanted to file recent compressed floater data 
	  in a "data/nexrad/" directory using the time, station, and product identifier 
	  in the file name, you might add an entry something like this to pqact.conf: 
	</p><pre>       NMC3 SDUS[2357]. .... (......) /p(...)(...)
                FILE -close -overwrite data/nexrad/\1\3\2.raw

  <li>Check your pqact.conf configuration file to make sure there are no syntax 
	errors: 
	<pre>       ldmadmin pqactcheck

  </li>
  <li>Send pqact a signal to reread pqact.conf so it can process new NEXRAD data: 
	<pre>       ldmadmin pqactHUP

<h3>FNEXRAD Feed</h3>

<p align="justify">To get <b>all</b> of the Unidata NEXRAD floater feed containing data for
several NEXRAD sites where "interesting" weather is occurring and
composite imagery created by the UPC from select NEXRAD Level III
products from all reporting stations:</p>

<ol>
<li>Edit your ldmd.conf configuration file to contain the line 

<pre>       request NMC3 ".*" <em>your.floater.feed</em>
      
</pre>
</li>

<p align="justify"><b>Caution:  <em>The NEXRAD composite imagery can consume quite a bit
of disk space after decoding.  For example, the 1 km National Base
Reflectivity Composite gets uncompressed to a 14 MB file.  Since his
product is transmitted every 6-10 minutes, you can consume a lot of
disk space in a short amount of time!</em></b>

</p><p>
</p><li>Stop your ldm: 

<pre>       ldmadmin stop
      
</pre>
</li>

<li>Make sure you wait until all the ldm processes have died before
restarting: 

<pre>       ldmadmin start
      
</pre>
</li>
</ol>


<br>

 

<p align="justify">To get a subset of the NEXRAD Level III products for the floater
sites, for example only the base
reflectivity and velocity products for the lowest tilt (N0R and N0V
products), replace the pattern for all products ".*" in the above
with a pattern for the specific products you want:</p>

<ol>
<li>Edit your ldmd.conf configuration file to contain the line 

<pre>       request NMC3 "/p(N0R|N0V)" <em>your.floater.feed</em>
      
</pre>
	3-character AFOS PIL codes for NEXRAD products are available from the <a href="/data/radar.html"><b>NOAAPORT NEXRAD Feed page</b></a>.</li>

<p>
</p><li>Stop your ldm with 

<pre>       ldmadmin stop
      
</pre>
</li>

<li>Wait until all the ldm processes have died before restarting,
with 

<pre>       ldmadmin start
      
</pre>
</li>
</ol>


<br>

<p align="justify">To get only the composite images in PNG-compressed format, replace
the pattern for all products ".*" in the above with a pattern for
the specific products:

</p><ol>
<li>Edit your ldmd.conf configuration file to contain the line 

<pre>       request NMC3 "^(pnga2area|rad)" <em>your.floater.feed</em>
      
</pre>

</li><li>Stop your ldm with 

<pre>       ldmadmin stop
      
</pre>
</li>

<li>Wait until all the ldm processes have died before restarting,
with 

<pre>       ldmadmin start
      
</pre>
</li>
</ol>

<p align="justify">To help you refine your ldmd.conf requests for FNEXRAD data, we provide
the following examples of IDD headers for the PNG-compressed composite images
(current as of May 17, 2002):

</p><h2>To get the NEXRAD products for a few selected sites</h2>

<p align="justify">To specify a few select sites for which NEXRAD data is always 
  desired, first get the 3-character site codes for the sites from the <a href="/data/floaters/nexlist.html"><b>NEXRAD 
  Site List</b></a> or from a <a href="http://www.intellicast.com/Local/USNationalStd.asp?loc=usa&amp;seg=LocalWeather&amp;prodgrp=NEXRADimagery&amp;product=BaseReflectivity&amp;prodnav=none&amp;pid=none"> 
  <b>NEXRAD Site Map</b></a>. For the examples, let's assume you choose to get 
  data from sites designated "ABC" and "XYZ":</p>

<ol>
<li>Edit your ldmd.conf configuration file to contain the line 

<pre>       request NNEXRAD "/p...(ABC|XYZ)" <em>your.nexrad.feed</em>
      
</pre>

after any other request lines, using tabs to delimit the
fields.</li>

<li>Stop your ldm with 

<pre>       ldmadmin stop
      
</pre>
</li>

<li>Make sure you wait until all the ldm processes have died before
restarting, with 

<pre>       ldmadmin start
      
</pre>
</li>
</ol>

<p align="justify">Note that if you want to change the site selection, it is
necessary to repeat all three of the above steps: there is no way
to get the LDM to reread the ldmd.conf file without stopping
and restarting it.</p>

 

<p align="justify">To get just a subset of products, say base reflectivity and base
radial velocity for the lowest tilt (N0R and N0V products), replace
the product pattern "..." in the above with a pattern for the
specific products you want:</p>

<pre>request NNEXRAD "/p(N0R|N0V)(ABC|XYZ)" <em>your.nexrad.feed</em>
</pre>

<p>which specifies 2 products from each of 2 sites.</p>

 

<p align="justify">To specify NEXRAD products from one of <a href="http://www.nws.noaa.gov/oso/prodhdrs.html"> 
  <b>10 U.S. regions</b></a>, you can specify a pattern that matches NEXRAD products 
  from only the desired region. For example, "SDUS[2357]4" designates products from 
  the South Central U.S. (TX, AL, MS, LA, AR, TN, OK):</p>

<pre>request NNEXRAD "^SDUS[2357]4" <em>your.nexrad.feed</em>
</pre>

<p align="justify">If you only wanted base reflectivity and base radial velocity
for the lowest tilt (N0R and N0V products) for radars in this
region, use:</p>

<pre>request NNEXRAD "^SDUS[2357]4 .* /p(N0R|N0V)" <em>your.nexrad.feed</em>
