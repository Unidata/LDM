    <h1>Canadian Meteorological Center's Global Environmental Multiscale (GEM) Model</h1>
    <p>The CMC's operational Global Environmental Multiscale (GEM) model - regional configuration - is integrated twice
      daily based on data valid at 00Z and 12Z.  For a general overview of our regional forecast system, please visit:
      <a href="https://collaboration.cmc.ec.gc.ca/science/rpn/gef_html_public/">GEM website</a>.</p>

    <p>Currently, 0-, 6-, 12-, 18-, 24-, 30-, 36-,  42-, and 48-hour forecasts of the following fields are available:
      (0-hour forecast is equivalent to the analysis)</p>
    <ul>
      <li>geopotential height at 1000, 850, 700, 500, 400, 250, 150, and 100 hPa</li>
      <li>air temperature at the above pressure levels as well as at the model surface</li>
      <li>wind components projected on the x- and y- axes of the grid at the same pressure levels as well as at the
        model surface</li>
      <li>dew-point depression at the same pressure levels as well as at the model surface</li>
      <li>pressure vertical velocity at the above pressure levels.</li>
      <li>sea-level pressure</li>
      <li>surface pressure</li>
      <li>accumulated total precipitation at surface</li>
      <li>instantaneous rainfall rate at surface</li>
      <li>total column cloud cover</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The above fields have been interpolated onto a Polar-Stereographic grid of 135 x 94 points and horizontal
      resolution equal to 60 km at 60 degrees N, centered over North America.</p>
    <p>The data has been encoded in the WMO's GRIB format.</p>
    <p>The data set contains 2 x 432 products per day with total volume of 17 Mb; one field per product except for the
      x-, y- wind components at a certain level which are grouped together.  The feed type is CMC and is normally
      available in the LDM queue by 04Z (16Z) for the model run based on observations valid at 00Z (12Z) on the same
      day.</p>

    <h2>Usage guidelines</h2>
    <p>he data is provided for educational and research purposes as per the

    <p>Re-distribution of the data, as they are or after processing, for other uses needs to be discussed and
      coordinated with the CMC. Users of the data need to be members of the
