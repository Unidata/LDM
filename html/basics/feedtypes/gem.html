<h2 align="center">Canadian Meteorological Center's Global Environmental Multiscale 
  (GEM) Model</h2>

<p align="justify"> The CMC's operational Global Environmental Multiscale (GEM) model - regional 
  configuration - is integrated twice daily based on data valid at 00Z and 12Z. 
  For a general overview of our regional forecast system, please visit: <a href="http://www.smc-msc.ec.gc.ca/cmc/op_systems/regional_forecast_e.html"> http://www.smc-msc.ec.gc.ca/cmc/op_systems/regional_forecast_e.html</a> </p>

<p align="justify">
Currently, 0-, 6-, 12-, 18-, 24-, 30-, 36-,  42-, and 48-hour forecasts of the 
following fields are available: (0-hour forecast is equivalent to the analysis)
</p><ul>
  <li>geopotential height at 1000, 850, 700, 500, 400, 250, 150, and 100 hPa</li>
  <li>air temperature at the above pressure levels as well as at the model surface</li>
  <li>wind components projected on the x- and y- axes of the grid at the same pressure levels as well as at the model surface</li>
  <li>dew-point depression at the same pressure levels as well as at the model surface</li>
  <li>pressure vertical velocity at the above pressure levels.</li>
  <li>sea-level pressure</li>
  <li>surface pressure</li>
  <li>accumulated total precipitation at surface</li>
  <li>instantaneous rainfall rate at surface</li>
  <li>total column cloud cover</li>
</ul>

<p align="justify">
The above fields have been interpolated onto a Polar-Stereographic grid of 135 
x 94 points and horizontal resolution equal to 60 km at 60 degrees N, centered 
over North America.
</p>
<p>
The data has been encoded in the WMO's GRIB format.
</p>
<p align="justify">
The data set contains 2 x 432 products per day with total volume of 17 Mb; one 
field per product except for the x-, y- wind components at a certain level 
which are grouped together.  The feed type is CMC and is normally available in 
the LDM queue by 04Z (16Z) for the model run based on observations valid at 00Z 
(12Z) on the same day.

<p align="justify"> Re-distribution of the data, as they are or after processing, 
  for other uses needs to be discussed and coordinated with the CMC. Users of 
  the data need to be members of the <a href="https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/community/index.html"><b>Unidata
  community</b></a> and have the <a href="../index.html"><b>LDM software</b></a> 
  up and running. </p>
