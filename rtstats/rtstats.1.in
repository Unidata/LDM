.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
This program scans an LDM product queue (see \fBpq\fP(3)) and creates 
products containing statistics about products being received.
The products are generated for each incoming feedtype and are assigned 
the EXP feedtype for transmission. Statistics are reported at 1 minute
intervals as new data are being received.

.B Rtstats
is typically used in to accumlate data for monitoring the performance
of a distributed LDM system. Statistics for various nodes in the system can 
be compared to ascertain the performance of the network. This program is
similar to \fBpqbinstats\fP(1) with the addition of the delivery of
the statistics via LDM protocol to a specified host.

A separate statistic product will be sent for each feedtype and LDM product origin.
That is, each LDM product will be named as follows:

.RS +4
  rtstats-LDMVERSION/LDMHOST/FEEDTYPE/PRODUCT_ORIGIN
.RE

where \fILDMVERSION\fP is the release number of the LDM distribution,
\fILDMHOST\fP is the machine where \fBrtstats\fP(1) is running, \fIFEEDTYPE\fP
is the class of the incoming data, and \fIPRODUCT_ORIGIN\fP is the assigned
identifier denoting the original injection host of the data
and upstream host identifier if available (LDM 5.2 and later).
In addition to cumulative statistics for the individual feeds,
the instantaneous product latency for the most recent product received 
is provided. The arriving statistics may be processed through
\fBpqact\fP(1).

.SH REPORTED STATISTICS
.TP
Creation-time of most recent product
.TP
Product-queue insertion-time of most recent product
.TP
Receiving host (eg localhost id)
.TP
Feedtype
.TP
Origin host
.TP
Products received since \fBrtstats\fP(1) started
.TP
Bytes received since \fBrtstats\fP(1) started
.TP
Latency of most recent product
.TP
Average latency of products received since \fBrtstats\fP(1) started
.TP
Peak latency@min/sec past the hour since \fBrtstats\fP(1) started
.TP
Version of LDM running on localhost

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B -v
Verbose logging.  A line is emitted for every product in the queue whose
feed type and identifier match the specified feedtype and pattern.  The
emitted line contains the UTC date and time, the program name, the product
ingest time, feedtype, sequence number, size in bytes, and the product
identifier.
.TP
.B -x
Debugging information is also emitted.
.TP
.BI "-H " hostname
Report as host \fIhostname\fP. The default is to report as the value of
registry parameter \fBregpath{HOSTNAME}\fP, if it is set, or the return value
of the \fBgethostname\fP(3) function, otherwise.
.TP
.BI "-h " remote
Requests that the statistic products be delivered to the LDM  server on
\fIremote\fP.
Defaults to localhost if not specified.
.TP
.BI \-l " logdest"
Log to \fIdest\fP. One of \fB''\fP (system logging daemon), \fB'-'\fP
(standard error stream), or file \fIlogdest\fP. Default is the standard error
stream if the process has a controlling terminal (i.e., the process isn't a
daemon); otherwise, either the LDM log file or the system logging daemon
(execute this program with just the option \fB'-?'\fP to determine which).
.TP
.BI \-f " feedtype"
Reads from the product queue only products that have a feedtype that is a
member of the \fIfeedtype\fP set.  The default is "\fBANY\fP", specifying all
feed types.  See \fBpqact\fP(1) for a list of basic feed types
and the use of feedtype expressions to specify combinations of basic
feed types.
.TP
.BI \-p " pattern"
Reads from the product queue only products whose identifier
matches the regular expression \fIpattern\fP.
The default is "\fB.*\fP", specifying all products.
.TP
.BI "-q " queue
The pathname of the data product queue.
The default is
.nh
\fB$(regutil regpath{QUEUE_PATH})\fP.
.hy
The configuration default can
be overridden by setting the environment variable \fBLDMPQFNAME\fP.
.TP
.BI \-i " interval"
Polling interval, in seconds.  When the end of the queue is reached, the
program sleeps and
checks for new products in the product queue every \fIinterval\fP seconds.
When
\fBrtstats\fP(1)
is run in the same process group as the programs that insert products into
the product queue, a signal informs
\fBrtstats\fP(1)
and all other interested processes in the process group
whenever a new product is available.
In this case, the interval should be set so that polling timer rarely expires.
The default interval is 15 seconds.
.TP
.BI \-o " offset"
Offset time, in seconds.
Begin reading products inserted into the product queue \fIoffset\fP
seconds earlier than the current time.
The default is to begin just after the time stamp of the oldest product
in the queue at startup.
.TP
.BI \-P " port"
Port on the remote system to which to connect.  The well-known LDM port is
388.
.SH SIGNALS
.TP
.BR SIGTERM
Normal termination.
.TP
.B SIGUSR1
Refresh logging (if configure(1) executed without the "--with-ulog" option).
.TP
.B SIGUSR2
Toggle logging of verbose messages.

.SH EXAMPLE
The following line may be added to the ldmd.conf file to automatically
start \fBrtstats\fP(1) when the LDM is started and deliver statistics to
the collection server at the Unidata Program Center.
