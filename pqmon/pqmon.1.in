.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
This program writes to \fIoutputfile\fP statistics to monitor the
state of a local
LDM product queue (see \fBpq\fP(3)). If no \fIoutputfile\fP is specified,
the data is written to standard output.  The program may be used to
display the current state of a product queue, to periodically
sample the product queue's state, or to help determine the parameters
that should be used for pqcreate, to create a product queue that will
not run out of product slots or waste space for unused product slots.
After reporting on the current state of the queue, pqmon exits,
unless a non zero \fIinterval\fP is specified.
.LP
.B pqmon
is typically used to verify that the product queue is peforming
adequately, is not close to running out of product slots, and is large
enough to hold products for a desired time period.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI "-S"
Writes modified output to the standard output stream (the "-l" option is
ignored except for error messages).  The output comprises a single line
of the following parameters, in order:
.RS +4
.TP
.B isFull
Whether or not the queue is full (i.e., whether or not an old data-product has
been deleted in order to make room for a new data-product).
.TP
.B dataCapacity
The size, in bytes, of the data portion of the queue.
.TP
.B dataHighWater
The high-water usage-mark of the data portion of the queue, in bytes.
.TP
.B dataCurrent
The the current usage of the data portion of the queue, in bytes.
.TP
.B prodCapacity
The number of products the queue can contain.
.TP
.B prodHighWater
The maximum number of products in the queue since it was created.
.TP
.B prodCurrent
The current number of products in the queue.
.TP
.B ageOldest
The age, in seconds, of the oldest data-product in the queue.
.TP
.B ageYoungest
The age, in seconds, of the youngest data-product in the queue.
.TP
.B minVirtResTime
The minimum virtual residence time, in seconds, of data-products in the queue.
The virtual residence time of a data-product is the time difference from when
the data-product was originally created to when it was removed from the local
product-queue.  The minimum virtual residence time is the smallest such value
over all data-products that have been removed from the queue since this metric
was initialized.  If the queue is not yet at equilibrium (i.e., if no
data-products have been deleted since this parameter was initialized) then this
metric will be -1.  This parameter can be reset via the \fBpqutil\fP(1)
utility.
.RE
.TP
.BI "-l " logfile
The path name of a file to be used as the log file for the process.  The
default is to use standard error when interactive and syslogd(8) otherwise.
To use syslogd from the command line, enter ``pqmon ... >& /dev/null''.
.TP
.BI "-q " pqfname
The filename of the product queue.
The default is
.nh
\fB$(regutil regpath{QUEUE_PATH})\fP.
.hy
.TP
.BI \-i " interval"
Polling interval, in seconds.  The program sleeps and
reports on the state of the product queue every \fIinterval\fP seconds.
If the \fIinterval\fP is 0, the program exits after one report (this
is the default if the "-i" option is missing).

.SH SIGNALS
.TP
.BR SIGTERM
Normal termination.
.TP
.BR SIGINT
Immediate termination.
.TP
.B SIGUSR1
Write status and product statistics to log output.

.SH EXAMPLE

The following invocation will report on the status of the default product
queue to stderr and then exit.
.RS +4
  pqmon
.RE
The following example will emit to stderr information about the
current state of the product queue in /tmp/ldm.pq, updated every 5
seconds:
.RS +4
  pqmon -q /tmp/ldm.pq -i 5
.RE
The following line in the ldmd.conf configuration file will cause a 
report of the status of the product queue to be logged every 10
minutes.
.RS +4
  exec "pqmon -i 600"
