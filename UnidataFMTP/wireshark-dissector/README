To install:
This wireshark plugin is built with cmake (in a separate build/ directory):
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake ..
  make
  make install

This will build the .so plugin for wireshark and install it into the user's 
~/.wireshark/plugins/ directory, which wireshark will load plugins from.

For developers:
This dissector is allowed to be further modified and improved. Regarding any
potential technical issues, please refer to Wireshark documentations.
