As (X)=−P(X=0)log2P(X=0)−P(X=1)log2P(X=1) Let’s take the word ‘baseball’ from your example. Its variable X has three observations (the number of sentences in your corpus): [1, 0, 0] This means that we have following probabilities:P(X=0)=23,P(X=1)=13. Therefore, the entropy of ‘baseball’ can be expressed as H(Xbaseball)=−23log223−13log213≈0.918 This is quite a big number, which points to high randomness.The funny thing is that in your example each word will have the same entropy, since every word appears only once. P.S. A more interesting way to investigate a corpus is to compute Mutual Information between pairs of words.P.P.S. In case you have a labeled dataset (genres/topics of texts), it is useful to find Mutual Information between words and labels: this way you’ll be able to find out, how much information about text label does a particular word contain. It is a very powerful feature selection approach.The ratio P/Po is a measure of how much radiation passed through the sample and is defined as the transmittance (T).T=PPoand%T=(PPo)×100(1.1.3)The higher the transmittance, the more similar P is to Po. The absorbance (A) is defined as:A=−logT or log(PoP).(1.1.4) The higher the absorbance, the lower the value of P, and the less light that makes it through the sample and to the detector. The way to think about this question is to consider the expression we wrote earlier for the absorbance. A=log(PoP)(1.2.2) Since stray radiation always leaks in to the detector and presumably is a fixed or constant quantity, we can rewrite the expression for the absorbance including terms for the stray radiation. It is important to recognize that Po, the power from the radiation source, is considerably larger than PS. Also, the numerator (Po + Ps) is a constant at a particular wavelength. A=log(Po+PsP+Ps)(1.2.3) Now let’s examine what happens to this expression under the two extremes of low concentration and high concentration. At low concentration, not much of the radiation is absorbed and P is not that much different than Po. Since Po >> PS, P will also be much greater than PS. If the sample is now made a little more concentrated so that a little more of the radiation is absorbed, P is still much greater than PS. Under these conditions the amount of stray radiation is a negligible contribution to the measurements of Po and P and has a negligible effect on the linearity of Beer’s Law. As the concentration is raised, P, the radiation reaching the detector, becomes smaller. If the concentration is made high enough, much of the incident radiation is absorbed by the sample and P becomes much smaller. If we consider the denominator (P + PS) at increasing concentrations, P gets small and PS remains constant. At its limit, the denominator approaches PS, a constant. Since Po + PS is a constant and the denominator approaches a constant (Ps), the absorbance approaches a constant. A plot of what would occur is shown in Figure 1.3.The velocity with which a solute moves in response to the applied electric field is called its electrophoretic velocity, νep; it is defined as νep=μepE(12.7.1) where μep is the solute’s electrophoretic mobility, and E is the magnitude of the applied electrical field. A solute’s electrophoretic mobility is defined as μep=q6πηr(12.7.2) Electroosmotic flow occurs because the walls of the capillary tubing are electrically charged. The surface of a silica capillary contains large numbers of silanol groups (–SiOH). At pH levels greater than approximately 2 or 3, the silanol groups ionize to form negatively charged silanate ions (–SiO–). Cations from the buffer are attracted to the silanate ions. As shown in Figure 12.56, some of these cations bind tightly to the silanate ions, forming a fixed layer. Because the cations in the fixed layer only partially neutralize the negative charge on the capillary walls, the solution adjacent to the fixed layer—what we call the diffuse layer—contains more cations than anions. Together these two layers are known as the double layer. Cations in the diffuse layer migrate toward the cathode. Because these cations are solvated, the solution is also pulled along, producing the electroosmotic flow. The definition of zeta potential given here is admittedly a bit fuzzy.

Chem. 2005, 77, 1753–1805. Although this a very technical report, Sections 1.3–1.5 provide a good introduction to the difficulty of defining the zeta potential and measuring its value.
